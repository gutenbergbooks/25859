<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ON A LOG</h3>
</div>

<p>I made the acquaintance of Ben Mayberry
under peculiar circumstances. I had charge of
the Western Union&#8217;s telegraph office in Damietta,
where my duties were of the most exacting
nature. I was kept hard at work
through the winter months, and more of it
crowded on me during the spring than I could
manage with comfort.
</p>
<p>I strolled to the river bank one summer
afternoon, and was sauntering lazily along
when I noticed a young urchin, who was floating
down-stream on a log, which had probably
drifted thither from the lumber regions above.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
The boy was standing upright, with a grin of
delight on his face, and he probably found
more real enjoyment in floating down-stream
in this style than any excursionist could obtain
in a long voyage on a palace steamer.
</p>
<p>He had on an old straw hat, through the
crown of which his brown hair protruded in
several directions; his pantaloons were held up
by a single suspender, skewered through them
in front by a tenpenny nail&mdash;an arrangement
which caused the garments to hang in a lopsided
fashion to his shoulders. He was barefooted,
and his trousers were rolled up to his
knees. He wore no coat nor vest, and his shirt
was of the coarsest muslin, but it was quite
clean.
</p>
<p>This boy was Ben Mayberry, then ten years
old, and he was a remarkable fellow in more
than one respect. His round face was not only
the picture of absolutely perfect health, but it
showed unusual intelligence and brightness.
His figure was beautiful in its boyish symmetry,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
and no one could look upon the lad without
admiring his grace, of which he was entirely
unconscious.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, Ben Mayberry was
known to possess two accomplishments, as
they may be called, to an extraordinary degree&mdash;he
was very swift of foot and could throw
with astonishing accuracy. Both of these attainments
are held in high esteem by all boys.
</p>
<p>I had met Ben at intervals during the year
past, but could hardly claim to be acquainted
with him. I usually bought my morning paper
of him during the cold weather, and I knew
that his father was killed by a blasting accident
some years before. Ben was the only child of
his widowed mother, who managed to eke out
a subsistence somehow with the aid of the little
fellow, who was ever ready and cheerful with
his work.
</p>
<p>While I stood looking at Ben, drifting
slowly down-stream, and reflected that the
water was fully two fathoms deep at that point,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
three other boys stopped on the bank below me
to view him. They were strangers to me, but
I observed they were unusually well dressed.
They had that effeminate, exquisite appearance
which satisfied me they were visitors from Boston,
sauntering along the river in order to learn
whether there was anything in our town
worthy of their attention. They were apparently
of nearly the same age, and each was
certainly one or two years older than Ben Mayberry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; exclaimed one, as the three came
to an abrupt halt, &#8220;look at that country boy
out on that log over there; he thinks he&#8217;s
smart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to show off, Rutherford,&#8221; said
another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, boys, let&#8217;s stone him,&#8221; suggested the
third, in a voice so guarded that I was barely
able to catch the words.
</p>
<p>The proposition was received with favor, but
one of them looked furtively around and noticed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
me. His manner showed that he was in
fear of my stopping their cruel sport.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares for him?&#8221; said one of the
party, in a blustering voice that it was meant I
should hear; &#8220;he&#8217;s nobody. I&#8217;ll tell him my
father is one of the richest men in Boston and
is going to be governor some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll let him know that my father has
taken me and our folks all over Yurrup. Pooh!
he daresn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Soothed by this conclusion, the three began
throwing stones at Ben.
</p>
<p>Ben was close at hand, and the first boy who
flung a missile poised and aimed with such deliberation
that I was sure Ben would be hit;
but the stone missed him by fully ten feet. It
was not until two more had been thrown that
Ben awoke to the fact that he was serving as a
target for the city youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you fellers doing?&#8221; he demanded,
looking angrily toward them. &#8220;Who
you trying to hit?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>They laughed, and the tallest answered, as
he flung another missile with great energy but
poor aim:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to knock you off that log,
Country! What are you going to do about
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you mighty soon,&#8221; answered the
sturdy lad, who straightway pushed the long
pole in his hand against the bottom of the river,
so as to drive the log in toward the shore where
his persecutors stood pelting him.
</p>
<p>There was something so plucky in all this
that several others stopped to watch the result.
I secretly resolved that if Ben got the worst of
it (as seemed inevitable against three boys), I
would interfere at the critical moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming ashore to whip us!&#8221; exclaimed
the tallest lad, almost dropping to the
ground with laughter. &#8220;I hope he will; I&#8217;ve
been taking sparring lessons of Professor Sullivan
for a year, and I would like the fun of
knocking him out of time. I can do it in three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
rounds, and I want you boys to stand back and
leave him to me. I&#8217;ll paralyze him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others were reluctant, each claiming the
happiness of demolishing the countryman; but
the tallest, who was called Rutherford, at last
secured their pledge that they would keep their
hands off and allow him to have all the fun to
himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try the cross-counter on him, the upper
cut, and then I&#8217;ll land a left-hander on his
jug&#8217;lar that&#8217;ll knock him stiff. Oh, how I ache
to get him within reach!&#8221;
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE COLLISION</h3>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Ben Mayberry was vigorously
working the log in toward shore. It moved
slowly, but the current was sluggish, the space
brief, and he was certain to land in a few
minutes.
</p>
<p>One of the stones struck Ben on the shoulder.
It must have angered him, for instead of trying
to dodge the rest, he used his pushing-pole
with more energy than before and paid no
heed to the missiles, several of which were
stopped by his body.
</p>
<p>It was plain that the valorous little fellow
meant to attack the three city lads, who were
pestering him not only with stones, but with
taunts that were far more exasperating.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder who blacked his shoes?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that hat a beauty? He can comb his
hair without taking it off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That one suspender must have cost him a
good deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By gracious, he&#8217;s going to chew us up,&#8221;
laughed the tallest, as the log approached land;
&#8220;stand back, boys, you promised him to me,
and I don&#8217;t want either of you to say you
helped me to knock him out in the third
round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next minute the log was so close that
the nimble-footed Ben leaped ashore and strode
straight for the valiant Rutherford, who immediately
threw himself in &#8220;position.&#8221; His
attitude was certainly artistic, with his left
foot thrown forward, his right fist clinched and
held across his breast, and his left extended
ready to be shot forward into the first opening
that his enemy presented.
</p>
<p>But it is one thing to assume the proper
pugilistic attitude; it is altogether another to
act the part of a trained pugilist.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Country!&#8221; called out the exultant
Rutherford; &#8220;but I hope you&#8217;ve bid
your friends farewell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other boys stood back and watched the
singular contest. I carefully approached so as
to be ready to protect Ben when it should become
necessary.
</p>
<p>The brave fellow never hesitated, but the
instant he landed lightly on the shore he went
straight for Rutherford, who, it was plain,
was slightly surprised and disconcerted by his
unscientific conduct. But the city youth kept
his guard well up, and the moment Ben was
within reach he struck a violent blow intended
for the face.
</p>
<p>But Ben dodged it easily, dropping his head
and running with cat-like agility directly under
the guard of his antagonist, who, before he
could understand precisely what it meant,
found himself clasped around the waist and
thrown on his back with such violence that a
loud grunt was forced from him, and his handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
new hat rolled rapidly down into the
water.
</p>
<p>And I am free to confess that I was delighted
when I saw Ben give him several of
his &#8220;best licks,&#8221; which made the tall boy roar
for mercy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him off, boys! he&#8217;s killing me!
Quick! I can&#8217;t live much longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others were terrified at the hurricane-like
style in which the boy had turned the
tables on the scientific Rutherford, but they
could not stand by and see their companion
massacred without raising a finger to help him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull him off!&#8221; yelled the victim, twisting
his body and banging his legs in the soft earth
in his vain effort to free himself from Ben, who
was pegging away at him. &#8220;Pull him off!
Put me on top, and I&#8217;ll settle him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the boys ran forward and reached out
his hand, intending to catch Ben by the shoulder
and fling him to the ground; but, to my
intense amazement and equally intense delight,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Ben caught his arm, jerked him forward across
the body of Rutherford, and belabored both of
them. It was one of the neatest feats I ever
saw performed, and, under the circumstances, I
would have pronounced it impossible had it
not been done before my own eyes.
</p>
<p>Both the hats of the Boston youths were floating
down the river, and they were so close to
the water&#8217;s edge that they were covered with
mud. The vigor of the assault on the two was
increased rather than diminished, and we spectators
were cruel enough to laugh heartily over
the exhibition, accompanied as it was by the
frenzied yells of the two lads who were receiving
the wrathful attentions of Ben Mayberry.
</p>
<p>The third boy could not stand it. He must
have thought they had come in collision with a
gorilla or some sort of wild animal, for he
started up the river bank, shouting &#8220;Murder!&#8221;
at the top of his voice. Ben, having got
through with the two under him, sprang off
and allowed them to rise, standing ready to
renew the fight should they show any desire to
do so.

<p>But they were too thoroughly vanquished.
Their plight was laughable, and yet pitiable.
They were coated with mud from head to foot,
and their pretty hats, with their polka-dot
bands, were gone too far down the river to be
recovered.
</p>
<p>They seemed dazed for a minute or so, but as
soon as they realized they were on their feet
they started off after their flying companion,
never pausing to look behind them, but running
as though a Bengal tiger was at their heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; said I, walking forward as soon as
I could assume a serious expression of countenance,
&#8220;do you not know it is very wrong to
fight?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was tryin&#8217; to teach them city
chaps. I guess they&#8217;ll think so after this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly did your best to convince
them it isn&#8217;t wise to attack you; but, Ben, what
have you been doing lately?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My last job was whipping them,&#8221; replied
the urchin, with a roguish twinkle of his blue
eyes; &#8220;but that was fun, and if you mean work,
I hain&#8217;t had anything but selling papers since
last summer, but sometimes I run errands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go to school?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like a job?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I would, sir, for mother finds it
hard work to get along, and sometimes there
isn&#8217;t anything to eat in the house. Once, when
I was a little fellow, when I saw mother crying,
and there was no bread, I slipped out at
night and stole a loaf, but mother would not
touch it when I brought it home, and made me
take it back. She told me I must starve before
I did wrong, and so I will. I have been trying
to get a job all summer, but everybody says I
am too young and small. I take all the exercise
I can, so as to make me grow, and that&#8217;s
one reason why I pitched into them city chaps
and laid &#8217;em out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ben, you know where the office of
the Western Union is; come around there to-morrow
morning, at eight o&#8217;clock, and I will
give you something to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m very thankful to you, sir, and this
will make my mother the happiest woman in
Damietta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I saw tears in the bright eyes, as Ben ran
home to carry the good news to his mother.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE OFFICE BOY</h3>
</div>

<p>When I approached the office the next morning,
little Ben Mayberry was standing outside,
smiling and expectant.
</p>
<p>My heart was touched when I saw what
pains his mother had taken to put her boy in
presentable shape. He had on a pair of coarse
shoes, carefully blacked, and a new, cheap
hat replaced the dilapidated one of the day before.
He wore a short coat and a vest, which
must have served him as his Sunday suit for a
long time, as they were much too small for
him.
</p>
<p>But there was a cleanly, neat look about him
which attracted me at once. His face was as
rosy as an apple, and his large, white teeth were
as sound as new silver dollars. His dark hair,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
which was inclined to be curly, was cut short,
and the ill-fitting clothes could not conceal the
symmetry of his growing figure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ben,&#8221; said I cheerily, as I shook his
hand, &#8220;I am glad to see you are here on time.
You are young, you know, but are old enough
to make a start. As I expect you to reach the
top of the ladder, I mean that you shall begin at
the bottom round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I am not sure he understood this figurative
language, but I made it clear to him the next
minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to be here every morning before
seven o&#8217;clock, to sweep out the office and make
it ready for business. You must see that all
the spittoons are cleaned, that the ink wells at
the desk are provided with ink, that the pens
are good enough for use (I never yet have seen
a public office where the writing facilities were
not wretched), abundance of blanks on hand,
and that everything is tidied up. In summer,
you must wash off the ice and place it in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
cooler, and in winter, see that the fires are
going and the office comfortable at the time
we go there for business. Can you do it, Ben?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and glad to have the chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This will give you some opportunity to
attend the public school, which, of course, you
will take advantage of. Then, when you can,
you will begin to study telegraphy. I will see
that you have every chance, and, at the same
time, I will give you a lift now and then in
your studies. This is the first step, Ben; in this
country anything is possible to the boy who has
brains, pluck, and application. Everything now
depends on yourself; with the help of Heaven
you will succeed; if you fail, it will be your own
fault. To-day you start on your career, which
will lead to success and happiness or to failure
and misery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben listened respectfully to what I said, and
seemed impressed by my words. I took him inside
the office, explained to him more particularly
his duties, gave him a key with which to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
enter in the morning, and told him to be on
hand at six o&#8217;clock on the morrow, until which
time he was excused. His wages were to be
two dollars a week, to begin from the day on
which I engaged him. Ben raised his hat, bade
me good-day, and went home, and I am sure
there was no happier boy in Damietta than he.
</p>
<p>It goes without saying that he attended to
his duties faithfully from the very first. He
went to the public school when he could gain
the chance. I learned that he was a favorite
there, on account of his manliness and excellent
scholarship. In conjunction with the principal
we arranged to give him private instruction at
night, so that during the day he could devote
his energies to learning telegraphy, in which
he displayed great aptitude.
</p>
<p>As I was manager of the office, it was in my
power to advance Ben as rapidly as circumstances
warranted. He was given to understand
from the first that he would be assisted to
the extent to which he proved himself deserving,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
and no further. I did not intend to spoil him
by undue favors, nor did I allow him to see
how much I really thought of him. One of the
surest means of ruining a boy is by partiality
and too rapid advancement; but I gave him an
encouraging word now and then, and took
pains to let his mother know that he was meeting
my high expectations, and that he was fully
worthy of the hopes she entertained of him.
</p>
<p>I shall never forget the glow which came
into the pinched face when I addressed her
thus, nor the devout expression which overspread
her countenance at my liberal praise of
her child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben has always been obedient to his father
and mother. I have never known him to swear
or tell an untruth, and he never took anything
that was not his own&mdash;that is,&#8221; the poor lady
hastened to add when she recalled the painful
circumstance, &#8220;he never forgot himself but
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me about it; few could blame him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
for that misstep; I cannot think the distressing
necessity will ever arise again. Should Heaven
spare his life he will become your staff, upon
which you can soon lean your whole weight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave a faint sigh of happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy Ben has never brought a pang to
his mother&#8217;s heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ah, my young friend, can your mother say
that? When that dear head is laid low, when
those loving eyes shall be closed forever, and
the sweet voice is hushed in the tomb, will you
be able to say through your blinding tears:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never brought a pang to her heart!&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A MESSAGE IN THE NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>At the end of a month Ben Mayberry was
made a messenger boy of the office under my
charge. This cannot be called a very momentous
promotion, inasmuch as many of our telegraphists
begin there; but it doubled Ben&#8217;s
wages at once, and led to his appearance in the
attractive blue uniform which the boys of the
Western Union wear. In his case it seemed
to add two inches to his stature at once.
</p>
<p>Ben was our best messenger from the first.
He was acquainted with the city of Damietta
from one end to the other, and his superior
fleetness of foot enabled him to outstrip the
others, while his cheerful, intelligent manner
added to his popularity with our customers.
</p>
<p>As he was so young, I determined to keep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
him messenger for a longer time than was
really necessary, affording him all the opportunity
he could ask in which to learn telegraphy.
He picked it up rapidly, and I was surprised
when I found him reading messages over the
wires by sound. As everyone knows, it takes
a skillful operator, or rather one of experience,
to do this, a proof that Ben was applying himself
to learning the business with all the power
at his command.
</p>
<p>In more than one instance, those who knew
the high estimation in which the boy was held
exerted themselves to put annoyances and obstructions
in his way. All manner of pretexts
were made for detaining him, and he showed
no little originality and ingenuity in outwitting
his very attentive friends.
</p>
<p>He continued to apply himself evenings,
when not on duty at the office, and his progress
was excellent in every respect. The kind principal
showed great interest in him, and at the
age of twelve Ben Mayberry possessed what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
may be called a good elementary English education.
</p>
<p>Before, however, these two years had passed
he could receive and send messages in a very
acceptable manner. His wages had been advanced,
and he now had his mother in comfortable
quarters, dressed tastefully himself,
and was developing into a handsome youth,
whose brilliant work had already attracted the
notice of the general superintendent.
</p>
<p>Ben had been an operator a little less than a
year when he met with a most extraordinary
experience, which to-day is a theme of
never-ending wonder to those who were living
in Damietta at the time.
</p>
<p>One evening a rough-bearded man entered
the office, and stepping to the counter, said to
me:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Burkhill&mdash;G. R. Burkhill&mdash;and
I am staying at the hotel in Moorestown.
I am expecting a very important dispatch to-night,
but I cannot wait for it. If it reaches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
this office before ten o&#8217;clock, I wish to have it
delivered to the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Moorestown lay directly across the river, and
was reached by the long, covered bridge which
spanned the stream. It was beyond our &#8220;jurisdiction,&#8221;
that is, outside the circle of free delivery,
which Mr. Burkhill understood, as he
remarked that he would pay well for the
trouble.
</p>
<p>I assured him that I would see that the telegram
reached him that night, if received before
ten o&#8217;clock. Thanking me, he said good-evening,
passed out, mounted his horse, and galloped
away in the wintry darkness.
</p>
<p>It was in the month of February, but the
weather was mild for that season, and there
had been a plentiful fall of rain. Ben was on
duty until ten, and he was in the very act of
rising from his seat when he called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Helloa! here comes the message for Mr.
Burkhill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was quite brief and Ben wrote it out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
rapidly, took a hasty impression, thrust it into
the damp yellow envelope, and whistled for a
messenger boy. There was only one present,
and he was a pale, delicate lad, who had gone
on duty that day after a week&#8217;s illness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Helloa, Tim; do you want to earn a half
dollar extra?&#8221; asked Ben, as the boy stood expectantly
before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to, if it isn&#8217;t too hard for
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben looked sharply at him and saw that the
boy was in too weak a state to undertake the
task. There was no other messenger within
call, and Mr. Burkhill was doubtless impatient
for the message whose delivery I had guaranteed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do for you to cross the river to-night,&#8221;
said Ben decisively; &#8220;the air is damp
and raw, and I think it is going to rain again.
I&#8217;ll do it for you, and whatever extra I collect
from Mr. Burkhill you shall have, Tim; now
go home and go to bed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>And waving me a good-night, Ben hurried
out of the door and vanished down the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like him,&#8221; I muttered, as I prepared
to go home; for except on special occasions
we closed our office at ten, or shortly
after. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t the first kindness he has
done that boy, and everyone in the office is
bound by gratitude to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As I stepped out on the street I observed
that the fine mist was turning into rain, and
another of those dismal nights, which are often
experienced in the Middle States during the
latter part of winter, was upon the city.
</p>
<p>I did not feel sleepy after reaching home.
My wife and two children had retired and were
sound asleep. There was no one astir but myself,
and drawing my chair to the fire, I began
reading the evening paper.
</p>
<p>Fully an hour had passed in this manner and
I was in the act of rising from my chair, with
the purpose of going to bed, when a sharp ring
of the bell startled me as though I had heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
burglars in the house. I felt instinctively that
something serious had happened as I hurried
to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Ben Mayberry take a telegraphic message
across the river to-night?&#8221; asked the man,
whom I recognized as a policeman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He started to do so,&#8221; I answered tremblingly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the last message he&#8217;ll ever deliver; he
has probably been killed!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>IN STORM AND DARKNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s the last message he&#8217;ll ever deliver,&#8221;
repeated the policeman; &#8220;Ben Mayberry has
probably been killed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>These were the terrible words spoken by the
man who had rung my bell in the middle of the
night, and startled me almost out of my senses.
I swallowed the lump in my throat, and with a
voice tremulous with emotion, said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! it cannot be. Who would kill
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean he was murdered,&#8221; the officer
hastened to add, seeing my mistake. &#8220;He was
on the middle span of the bridge when it was
carried away by the flood, and that&#8217;s the last of
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I drew a great sigh of relief. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
something unspeakably dreadful in the thought
of noble Ben Mayberry being killed by anyone,
and it lifted a vast burden from my shoulders
to be told that no such awful fate had overtaken
him.
</p>
<p>But instantly came the staggering terror
that the boy had gone down in the wreck and
ruin, and at that moment was floating among
the great masses of ice and débris that were
sweeping swiftly down the river toward the
sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was it?&#8221; I asked, after the officer
had refused my invitation to enter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The river began rising very fast at dark,
but the bridge has stood so many freshets we
were hopeful of this. The water was at the
top of the abutments at nine o&#8217;clock and was
still creeping up. Jack Sprall, who is off duty
to-night, was down by the bridge watching
things. A little after ten o&#8217;clock, Ben Mayberry
came along and said he had a message which he
had promised to deliver to a gentleman at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
hotel in Moorestown. Jack told him the
bridge was unsafe, but Ben said he knew how
to swim, and started across, whistling and jolly
as usual. Jack said at the same time he heard
the sound of wheels, which showed that a
wagon or carriage had driven on from the
other side, which never ought to have been allowed
when things were looking so shaky.
Ben had just about time to reach the middle of
the bridge when the crash came, and the big
span was wiped out, as though it was a chalk
mark on a blackboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know of a surety that Ben
Mayberry did not save himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very active and strong, I know,
which made Jack hope he had pulled through.
In spite of the danger of the rest of the bridge
going, Jack crept out over it to the abutment,
and shouted to Ben.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed that a couple of men had done
the same from Moorestown, and they stood on
the other abutment, with the middle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
river sweeping between and threatening to
take away the rest of the tottering bridge every
minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Jack called, they answered, though
it was too dark to see each other, and they
asked Jack whom he was looking for. He told
them that Ben Mayberry had gone on the
bridge a few minutes before from this side, and
he was afraid he had been swept away. They
said there could be no doubt of it, as he had not
reached the span on which they were standing.
They then asked Jack whether he had seen anything
of a horse and carriage, which drove on
the bridge from the Moorestown side, and
which they had come out to see about. Of
course Jack could only make the same answer,
and when they explained, it was learned that
the carriage contained a lady and small child&mdash;so
three lives have been lost from people not
doing their duty in keeping folks out of
danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the mother of Ben know anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
about this?&#8221; I asked, with a shudder at the
thought of her terrible grief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I went up to her house and told her
first, as I thought it my duty to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor woman! she must have been overcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was at first, and then when she asked
me to tell her all about it, and I had done so,
she said very quietly that she didn&#8217;t believe her
boy was drowned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do I believe it!&#8221; I exclaimed, with a
sudden thrill of hope. &#8220;Ben Mayberry is one
of the best swimmers I ever saw; he went down
with the lumber of the central span, and even
if he could not swim, he had a good chance to
float himself on some of the timbers or blocks
of ice which are buoyant enough to support a
dozen men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All that is very true,&#8221; replied the policeman,
who seemed to have thought of everything;
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t deny that there is just the
barest possibility in the world that you&#8217;re right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
But you mustn&#8217;t forget that the roof of the
bridge was over him, and has shut out the
chance of his helping himself. Don&#8217;t you believe
that, if he was alive, he would have
answered the calls that Jack made to him?
Jack has a voice like a fog-horn, and Ben would
have heard him if he was able to hear anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This view of the case staggered me, and I
hardly knew what to say, except to suggest
that possibly Ben had answered the call, and
was unheard in the rushing waters; but the
officer shook his head, and I confess I shared
his doubts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as the splintering timbers went down,
Jack did hear the shout of Ben; he heard, too,
the scream of a woman, and that awful cry
which a horse sometimes makes when in the
very extremity of peril, but that was all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I could not sleep after such horrifying tidings,
when the policeman had gone; I went
into the house and donned my overshoes and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
rubber coat. Fortunately my family had not
been awakened by the ringing of the bell, and I
did not disturb them; but, carefully closing
and locking the door after me, I went out in the
storm and darkness, oppressed by a grief which
I had not known for years, for Ben Mayberry
was as dear to me as my own son, and my heart
bled for the stricken mother who, when she
most needed a staff to lean upon during her declining
years, found it cruelly snatched from
her.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;TELL MOTHER I AM ALL RIGHT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>There is a fascination in the presence of
danger which we all feel. The news of the
dreadful disaster spread with astonishing
rapidity, and when I reached the river-side it
seemed as if all Damietta were there.
</p>
<p>The lamps twinkled in the hands of innumerable
men moving hither and thither in that restless
manner which showed how deep their feelings
were. People were talking in guarded
voices, as if the shadow of an awful danger impended
over them, and the wildest rumors, as
is the case at such times, were afloat. It was
said that six, eight, and a dozen persons had
gone down with the bridge and were irrecoverably
lost. Other structures above us were
carried away (though no one stopped to explain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
how the tidings had reached ahead of the
flood itself), and it was asserted that not a span
would be left on the stream at daybreak.
</p>
<p>The flickering lanterns gave a glimpse of the
scene which rendered it more impressive than
if viewed under the glare of midday. Some
daring ones ventured out to the first abutment
despite the danger, and we saw the glare of
their lanterns on the rushing, muddy water and
the immense blocks of ice. Some of the latter
would impinge against the stone abutment with
a prodigious grinding crash, spin around several
times, and then mount up from the water,
crowded by others behind, as though it was
about to climb over the massive stone. Then
it would tumble back with a splash and swiftly
sweep out of sight in the darkness.
</p>
<p>Again, trees, with their bushy tops tossing
above the surface, glided by as if caught in a
rushing mill-race, and a grotesque character
was given to the whole scene by the sudden
crowing of some cocks, which must have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
frightened by the twinkling lights so near
them.
</p>
<p>Few in Damietta went to bed that night.
There was a continual walking to and fro, as
people are seen to do when some great calamity
is about to break upon them. Several mounted
horses and rode down the river-bank for miles,
in the weak hope of picking up tidings of the
lost ones. No one could be found who knew
the lady and child in the carriage which came
upon the bridge from the other side. There
were innumerable guesses as to their identity,
but they were guesses and nothing more. No
doubt was entertained that when communication
could be opened with Moorestown on the
morrow, we would learn who they were.
</p>
<p>I stayed at the river-side for an hour,
weighed down by the greatest grief of my life.
I was anxious to do something, but there was
absolutely nothing for me to do. Ben was
gone, and his friends could not begin an intelligent
search for him before the morrow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>I turned on my heel to go home, when a
shout went up that the span on the other side of
the center was going. There could be no doubt
that the splintering crash and the grinding
swirl of waters and ice were caused by the destruction
of that span which dissolved into
nothingness almost in a moment.
</p>
<p>This started the cry that the timbers nearest
us were breaking up.
</p>
<p>Those who were on it made a rush for shore,
which was not reached a minute too soon. The
entire span suddenly lifted up and was
&#8220;snuffed out&#8221; so promptly that the wonder
was how it had withstood the flood so long.
</p>
<p>This occurrence struck me as decisive of the
fate of my young friend Ben Mayberry. It
gave me an appreciation of the tremendous irresistibility
of the freshet, which must have
ended the lives of the hapless party almost on
the instant. The bravest swimmer would be
absolutely helpless in the grasp of such a terrific
current, and in a night of pitchy darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
would be unable to make the first intelligent
effort to save himself.
</p>
<p>At last I went home through the drizzling
rain, as miserable a mortal as one could imagine.
When I reached the house I was glad
to find that my family were still asleep. It
would be time enough for them to learn of my
affliction and the public disaster on the coming
morrow.
</p>
<p>The pattering of the rain on the roof accorded
with my feeling of desolation, and I
lay awake until almost daylight, listening,
wretched, dismal, and utterly despairing.
</p>
<p>I slept unusually late, and I was glad, when
I went down to my breakfast, to learn that
some kind neighbor had told my family all I
knew, and indeed, a little more. The river
rose steadily until daylight, by which time it
was two feet above the abutments, and not a
vestige of the bridge remained.
</p>
<p>But the water had reached its highest point,
for, after remaining stationary an hour, it had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
begun to fall, and was now a couple of inches
lower than &#8220;high-water mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were two things which I dreaded&mdash;the
sight of the furious river, and to meet the sad,
white face of Ben Mayberry&#8217;s mother. I felt
that I could give her no word of comfort, for I
needed it almost as much as did she. She must
have abandoned all hope by this time, and her
loss was enough to crush life itself from her.
</p>
<p>When walking along the street I found that
everyone was talking about the unexampled
flood. It had overflowed the lower part of the
city, and people were making their way
through the streets in boats. Scores of families
were made homeless, and the sights were curious
enough to draw multitudes thither.
</p>
<p>I kept away from every point where I could
catch so much as a glimpse of the freshet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have robbed me of the brightest and
best boy I ever knew,&#8221; I muttered, in bitterness
of spirit; &#8220;he was one whom I loved as if
he were a son.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>The shadow of death seemed to rest on the
office when I reached it. The loss of Ben Mayberry
was a personal affliction to everyone
there. Only the most necessary words were
spoken, and the sighing, which could be heard
at all times, came from the heart.
</p>
<p>I went to my desk in a mechanical way, and
had just placed my hand on the instrument,
when I was thrilled by a call which I would
have recognized among a thousand. Others
heard and identified it also, and held their
breath. The next instant this message reached
me:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mr. Melville</span>&mdash;Tell mother I am
all right, but in need of dry clothing.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A THRILLING VOYAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>On the night that Ben Mayberry started
across the bridge to deliver the cipher message
to Mr. Burkhill in Moorestown, he had reached
the center span before he felt he was in personal
danger. The few lamps which twinkled
at long distances from each other were barely
enough for him to see where he was going, and
they did little more than make the darkness
visible.
</p>
<p>By the faint light he observed a carriage and
single horse approaching. The animal lifted
his feet high, walked slowly, and snuffed the
air as he turned his head from side to side, like
an intelligent creature which feels he is approaching
danger. The rattling of the narrow
planks under his hoofs and the carriage wheels
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
could be heard above the roar and sweep of the
angry river beneath.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the bridge trembled under a blow
received from a gigantic piece of ice, which
went grinding and splashing with such violence
that its course could be followed by the bulging
upward of the planks between Ben and the
horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious! this won&#8217;t do,&#8221; exclaimed
the boy, more alarmed for the vehicle and its
occupants than for himself.
</p>
<p>He ran forward to grasp the bridle of the
horse with the purpose of turning him back,
when he saw that he had stopped of his own
accord, and was snorting with terror. Ben
reached up to seize the bit, when he was made
dizzy by the abrupt lifting of the planking underneath,
and was thrown violently forward on
his face.
</p>
<p>The brave boy knew what it meant, and kept
his senses about him. It was utterly dark, and
he was in the icy water with a terrified horse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
struggling fiercely, and in danger of beating
out the boy&#8217;s brains with his hoofs, while the
shriek of the agonized mother rose above the
horrid din:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Save my child&mdash;save my child!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fortunately for Ben Mayberry the bridge
broke up in a very unusual manner. Instead
of the roof coming down upon him, it seemed
to fall apart, as did the narrow planking. Thus
his movements were not interfered with by the
structure, and realizing what a desperate struggle
for life was before him, he drew off his
cumbersome overcoat with great deftness, and
then swam as only a strong swimmer can do in
the very extremity of peril.
</p>
<p>He heard nothing more of the horse, which
had doubtless perished after a struggle as brief
as it was fierce; but, unable to see anything at
all, Ben struck out toward the point whence
came the cry of the mother, and which was
close at hand.
</p>
<p>He had scarcely made three strokes when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
came in violent collision with a huge block of
ice in his path. Without attempting to go
around it, he grasped the edge, and, by a determined
effort, drew himself upon it. Fragments
of the bridge were all around, and he
felt some of the timber upon the support.
</p>
<p>While crawling carefully toward the other
side, he shouted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Helloa! where are you? Answer, and I&#8217;ll
help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint cry made itself heard amid the rushing
waters and the impenetrable darkness. It
was just ahead, and the next instant Ben had
reached the other side of the ice raft, where,
steadying himself with one hand, he groped
about with the other, uttering encouraging
words as he did so.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he caught hold of a delicate arm,
and with another cheery shout, he began drawing
with all his strength.
</p>
<p>It was a hard task, under the circumstances,
but he quickly succeeded, and was not a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
amazed to find that instead of a lady he had
helped out a small girl.
</p>
<p>But it was the cry of a mother that had
reached his ears, and he did his utmost (which
unfortunately was little) to help her. He
called again and again, but there was no answer.
He asked of the child the whereabouts
of her parents, but the little one was almost
senseless with bewilderment, cold, and terror,
and could give no intelligible answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be drowned,&#8221; was the sorrowful
conclusion of Ben, who was forced to cease his
efforts; and I may as well add at this point,
that he was right; the mother&#8217;s body being carried
out to sea, where it was never found.
</p>
<p>For the time, Ben and the little girl were
safe, but it will be seen that their condition was
pitiable. It was a wintry night, the water was
of an arctic temperature, and their clothing was
saturated. The icy floor on which they were
supported would have added to their terrible
discomfort, had he not been able to gather together
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
several of the planks within reach, with
which he made a partition between them and
the freezing surface.
</p>
<p>Ben shouted at the top of his voice, but he
was so far below the place where the bridge
had stood that no one heard him, and he finally
gave it up, knowing that even if he made himself
known to friends, they would be powerless
to help him so long as the darkness lasted.
</p>
<p>The child, so far as he could judge, was no
more than nine or ten years old, but she was
richly clad, as he learned from the abundance
of furs, silks, and velvet. She had luxuriant
hair, which streamed about her shoulders, and
he was sure she must be very beautiful.
</p>
<p>She was alive, but faint and suffering. She
did not wish to talk and Ben did not urge her,
although he was curious to know her identity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will learn all in the morning,&#8221; he said to
himself; &#8220;that is, if we are spared until then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was too excited and terrified to fall
asleep, even had his discomfort not been too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
great to permit it, and he found he needed his
wits about him.
</p>
<p>Now and then the cake of ice which supported
them was crowded by others, until it
seemed on the point of being overturned, in
which event another terrible struggle would
be necessary to save himself and the little girl.
</p>
<p>Then again, there seemed to be eddies and
whirlpools in the current, which threatened to
dislodge them or to break up the miniature iceberg
into fragments, as the bridge itself was
destroyed.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE CIPHER TELEGRAM</h3>
</div>

<p>The almost interminable night came to an
end at last and the dull gray of morning appeared
in the east.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry chafed the arms of the little
stranger, and even slapped her vigorously to
prevent her succumbing to the cold. He was
forced to rise to his feet himself at intervals
and swing his arms and kick out his legs, to
fight off the chilliness which seemed to penetrate
to his very bones.
</p>
<p>As soon as the boy could make use of his
eyes he found himself drifting through the
open country, where the river was fully double
the width at Damietta. This gave the masses
of ice much more &#8220;elbow room,&#8221; and decreased
the danger of capsizing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Houses and villages were seen at intervals,
and multitudes of people were along the bank
gathering driftwood and &#8220;loot,&#8221; and watching
the unparalleled flood of waters.
</p>
<p>Ben swung his hat and shouted, and at last
caught the notice of the people on the bank.
Two sturdy watermen sprang into a boat and
began fighting their way out to the helpless
ones. It was a hard task, but they succeeded,
and Ben and little Dolly Willard (as she had
given her name) were safely taken off. A
crowd waited to welcome them and they received
every possible attention. Both were
taken to the nearest farmhouse, where a kind-hearted
mother took Dolly in charge, for the
little one needed it sadly enough.
</p>
<p>They were within half a mile of a village
which was connected with Damietta by telegraph,
and before Ben would do anything more
than swallow a cup of hot coffee, and change
his clothing, he was driven to the office, where
he sent the message which was the first word
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
we received in Damietta to tell us that he was
alive.
</p>
<p>I lost no time in hurrying to the humble
dwelling of Mrs. Mayberry, where I made
known the joyful tidings. I shall never forget
the holy light which illumined the thin face as
she clasped her hands in thankfulness and
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not given up all hope, but I was very
near doing so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben was driven into Damietta late that
afternoon, where a royal welcome awaited him.
He was cheered, shaken by the hand, and congratulated
over and over again, and for a time
it looked as though he would be pulled asunder.
When he finally tore himself loose and rushed
into our office, the operators and messenger
boys were equally demonstrative, but he did
not mind them.
</p>
<p>I stood at my desk with a swelling heart,
waiting for him. Suddenly he turned and
caught my hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He that is born to be hanged will never be
drowned&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was laughing when he spoke the jest,
but his voice trembled, and all at once he broke
down. Quickly withdrawing both hands, he
put them over his face and cried like a heartbroken
child. He had stood it like a hero to
this point, but now, with the crowd outside
peering into the windows, he sobbed with uncontrollable
emotion, while my own heart was
too full to speak.
</p>
<p>As soon as he could master himself he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must not wait any longer; mother expects
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was out of the door in a twinkling, and
in a few minutes the mother and son were in
each other&#8217;s arms.
</p>
<p>The reader may think that the most remarkable
part of Ben Mayberry&#8217;s adventure on the
night of the flood has already been told, but it
proved to be the beginning of a train of incidents
of such an extraordinary nature that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
hasten to make them known. There was a direct
connection between his experience on that
terrible night in February and the wonderful
mystery in which he became involved, and
which exercised such a marked influence on
his after-life.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, little Dolly Willard suffered no
serious consequences from her frightful shock
and exposure. She received such excellent care
that she speedily recovered, and as soon as we
could re-establish communication with Moorestown
and engage her in conversation, we
learned something of her history.
</p>
<p>She lived in New York City and had come to
Moorestown on a visit with her mother and
Uncle George. He was the G. R. Burkhill who
failed to receive the cipher dispatch which Ben
Mayberry undertook to deliver to him on that
eventful night.
</p>
<p>Dolly said her father was dead, or had been
gone from home a very long time. Uncle
George claimed and took her to the city, first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
sending a cipher dispatch to a party in the
metropolis, and directing me, in case of an
answer, to hold it until he called or sent for it.
</p>
<p>Two days later an answer arrived in the
same mystic characters as before. As it has
much to do with the incidents which follow, I
give this remarkable telegram in full:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>New York</span>, February 28th,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Cipher telegrams are sent every day in the
week, and we did not concern ourselves with
this particular one, which would have received
no further thought, but for an odd circumstance.
</p>
<p>On the day Mr. Burkhill sent his message
to New York, he was followed into our office
by a man who was shabbily dressed, and who
impressed me as what is commonly called a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
&#8220;beat.&#8221; He spoiled several blanks without
sending a message and then abruptly tore them
up, put the pieces in his pocket, and walked out
after Mr. Burkhill.
</p>
<p>He was in the office several times the succeeding
two days, made some inquiries, and
sent off a couple of messages. Just after Ben
Mayberry had received the cipher telegram
given above, I happened to look across my desk
and observed that the fellow had taken every
letter, marking it down, as he easily interpreted
it by sound.
</p>
<p>It was only by accident that I made this discovery,
for the man acted precisely as if he
were preparing a message to send away.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE TRANSLATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. G. R. Burkhill overwhelmed Ben
Mayberry with thanks for the heroic manner in
which he saved his niece and strove to save his
sister. He offered the boy a handsome reward,
but I am glad to say Ben refused to accept it.
He promised to write the boy concerning the
little one, but he must have forgotten his promise,
as a long time passed without anything
being heard from him.
</p>
<p>When I discovered that the seedy lounger
about our office had carefully taken down the
cipher telegram addressed to Burkhill, I was
indignant, for it was well known that one of
the most important duties which the telegraph
companies insist upon is the inviolability of the
messages intrusted to their wires. Nothing less
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
than a peremptory order from the court is
sufficient to produce the telegrams placed in
our care.
</p>
<p>I was on the point of leaving my desk and
compelling the impudent stranger to surrender
the cipher he had surreptitiously secured, but I
restrained myself and allowed him to go without
suspecting my knowledge of his act.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; said I, addressing my young friend,
whom I trusted beyond any of the older operators,
&#8220;did you notice that fellow who just
went out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I have seen him before. He followed
me home last night, and after I went in
the house, he walked up and down the pavement
for more than half an hour. He was
very careful, but I saw him through the
blinds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he ever said anything to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, except in the office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He took down every letter of that cipher
telegram you just received for Mr. Burkhill.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>The boy was surprised and sat a minute in
deep thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Melville,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you have no objection,
I shall study out that cipher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I think is impossible; it has been prepared
with care, and it will take a greater expert
than you to unravel it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben smiled in his pleasing way as he answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fond of unraveling puzzles, and I
believe I can take this apart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be surprised if you succeed; but if
you do, keep it a secret from everyone but
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may depend on that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The odd times which Ben could secure
through the day were spent in studying the
mysterious letters; but when he placed it in his
pocket at night and started for home, he had
not caught the first glimmer of its meaning.
</p>
<p>But he was hopeful and said he would never
give it up until he made it as clear as noonday,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and I knew that if it was within the range of
accomplishment, he would keep his word. I
have told enough to show my readers he was
unusually intelligent and quick-witted, but I
am free to confess that I had scarcely a hope of
his success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was the whispered exclamation with
which Ben Mayberry greeted me the next
morning when he entered the office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! You&#8217;re jesting,&#8221; I answered, convinced,
at the same time, that he was in earnest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon show you,&#8221; was his exultant response.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was it you struck the key?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hard to tell, more than you can explain
how it is, after you have puzzled your
brain for a long time over an arithmetical problem,
it suddenly becomes clear to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat down by my desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured and studied, and tried those letters
every way I could think of until midnight,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and was on the point of going to bed, when the
whole thing flashed upon me. You know, Mr.
Melville, that in trying to unravel a cipher, the
first thing necessary is to find the key-word, for
it must be there somewhere; and if you look
sharp enough it will reveal itself. One single
letter gave it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will look at the telegram,&#8221; said Ben,
spreading it out before me, &#8220;you will notice
that in one instance only is a single letter seen
standing by itself. That is the letter &#8216;b,&#8217; which
I concluded must stand for the article &#8216;a,&#8217; for
I know of no other, unless it is &#8216;I.&#8217; Now, the
letter &#8216;b&#8217; is the second one in the alphabet, and
stands next in order to &#8216;a.&#8217; If this system is
followed throughout the cipher, we have only
to take, instead of the letters as written, the
next in order as they occur in the alphabet.
But when I tried it on the following word, it
failed entirely. Luckily I tested the second in
the same manner, and I was surprised to find it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
made a perfect word, viz.: &#8216;chance.&#8217; The third
came to naught, but the fourth developed into
&#8216;your.&#8217; That proved that every other word of
the message was constructed in this manner, and
it did not take me long to bring them out into
good English. This was a big help, I can tell
you, and it was not long before I discovered
that in the alternate words the system reversed;
that is, instead of taking the letter immediately
succeeding, the writer had used that which immediately
precedes it in the alphabet. Applying
this key to the telegram, it read thus:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Must wait till fall; Sam has a better
chance south. Your bank will keep.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; added Ben, who was warranted in
feeling jubilant over his success, &#8220;that is a
very ordinary cipher&mdash;one which hundreds
would make out without trouble. Had the
writer run his letters all together&mdash;that is,
without any break between the words&mdash;I would
have been stumped. Besides, he uses no blind
words, as he ought to have done; and it looks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
very much as if he calls everything by its right
name, something which I should think no person
anxious to keep such a secret would do. If
he means &#8216;bank,&#8217; he might as well have called
it by another name altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think ordinarily he would have been safe
in writing his cipher as he has done; but, be
that as it may, I am confident you have made a
most important discovery.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>FARMER JONES</h3>
</div>

<p>The conclusion which I formed respecting
the cipher telegram, so cleverly translated by
Ben Mayberry, was that it concerned an intended
robbery of one of the banks in Damietta,
and that the crime, for the reason hinted
in the dispatch, was postponed until the succeeding
autumn.
</p>
<p>Under such circumstances it will be seen
that it was my duty to communicate with the
general manager of the company, which I proceeded
to do without delay. In reply, he instructed
me to place myself in communication
with the mayor of the city, whose province it
was to make provision against what certainly
looked like a contemplated crime.
</p>
<p>This instruction was carried out, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
mayor promptly took every means at his command
to checkmate any movement of the suspected
party. He arranged to shadow him by
one of the best detectives in the country, while
I agreed to notify him of the contents of any
more suspicious telegrams passing over the
wires.
</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that the friends of Ben
Mayberry and myself took care that his exploit
on the memorable winter night should not
pass by unnoticed. The single daily paper published
in Damietta gave a thrilling account of
the carrying away of the bridge, and the terrible
struggle of the boy in the raging river&mdash;an
account which was so magnified that we
laughed, and Ben was angry and disgusted.
One of the best traits of the boy was his modesty,
and it was manifest to everyone that this
continued laudation was distasteful to him in
the highest degree.
</p>
<p>The cap-sheaf came when one of the metropolitan
weeklies published an illustration of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
scene, in which Ben was pictured as saving not
only the mother and daughter, but the horse as
well, by drawing them by main force upon an
enormous block of ice! There was not the
slightest resemblance to the actual occurrence,
and the picture of our young hero looked as
much like me as it did like Ben, who would
have cried with vexation had not the whole
thing been such a caricature that he was compelled
to laugh instead.
</p>
<p>But the general manager received a truthful
account from me, together with the statement
that Ben Mayberry alone deserved the credit
for deciphering the telegram which foreshadowed
an intended crime. Corporations, as a
rule, are not given to lavish rewards, but the
letter which the manager sent to Ben was more
highly prized than if it had been a gold watch
studded with diamonds, or a deed for the best
house in Diamietta. His heart throbbed when
he read the warm words of praise from the
highest officer in the company, who told him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
continue faithfully in the path on which he had
started, and his reward was certain. That letter
Ben to-day counts among his most precious
prizes, and nothing would induce him to part
with it.
</p>
<p>The best thing about this whole business was
the fact that Ben never lost his head through the
profusion of compliments from those in authority.
He realized that the straight road to
success lay not through accidental occurrences,
which may have befriended him, but it was
only by hard, painstaking, and long-continued
application that substantial and enduring success
is attained.
</p>
<p>Ben was always punctual at the office, and
never tried to avoid work which he might have
contended, and with good reason, did not belong
to him. His obliging disposition was
shown by his volunteering to deliver the message
which nearly cost him his life. The duty
of the telegraphist is very confining, and so
exacting that the most rugged health often
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
gives way under it, and persons take to other
business before completely broken up. But
this debility is often the fault of the operators
themselves, who sit bent over their desks, smoking
villainous cigarettes or strong tobacco, who
ride in street cars when they should gladly
seize the chance to walk briskly, and who, I am
sorry to say, drink intoxicating liquors, which
appear to tempt sedentary persons with peculiar
power.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry had none of these baneful
habits. He lived a long distance from the office,
and although the street cars passed within
a block of his home, I never knew him to ride
on one, no matter how severe the weather
might be.
</p>
<p>Besides this, he belonged to a baseball club,
and, in good weather, when we were not
pushed, managed to get away several times a
week during which he gained enough vitality
and renewed vigor to last him for days.
</p>
<p>One particularly busy afternoon, just as Ben
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
had finished sending off a lengthy dispatch,
someone rapped sharply on the counter behind
him, and turning, he saw an honest-looking
farmer, who had been writing and groaning
for fully twenty minutes before he was ready
to send his telegram.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you send that to Makeville, young
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Ben, springing to his
feet, and taking the smeared and blotted paper
from his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jist let me know how much it is; I s&#8217;pose
it ain&#8217;t more than twenty or thirty cents.
There ain&#8217;t much use in sending it, but Sally
Jane, that&#8217;s my daughter, was anxious for me
to send her a telegraphic dispatch, &#8217;cause she
never got one, and she&#8217;ll feel proud to see how
the neighbors will stare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben had started to count the words, but he
paused, and repressing a smile over the simplicity
of the man, said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very expensive to send messages by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
telegraph, and it will cost you several dollars
to send this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunderation!&#8221; broke in the indignant old
man, growing red in the face. &#8220;I won&#8217;t patronize
any sich frauds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He started to go out, when Ben checked him
pleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be too bad to disappoint your
daughter, and we can arrange to send her a message
with very little expense. There are many
words here which can be left out without affecting
the sense. Please run your pen through
these, and let me look at it again.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE VALUE OF COURTESY</h3>
</div>

<p>The following is the message as first written
out by the old farmer:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Sally Jane Jones</span>, Makeville,&mdash;I take my
pen in hand to inform you that I arrived safely
in Damietta this morning. I have seen Jim,
your brother. His baby is dead in love with
me, and they all join in sending their love to
you. I expect to eat my supper with Cousin
Maria and sleep in their house by the river. I
will be home to-morrow afternoon. Meet me
at the station with the roan mare, if she ain&#8217;t
too tired to draw the buggy.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;Your affectionate father,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Josiah A. Jones</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>When Ben Mayberry had explained how
much could be saved by crossing out the superfluous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
words in this message, while its main
points would be left, the farmer&#8217;s anger turned
to pleasure. He took his pen, nodded several
times, and turned smilingly to the desk, where
he stood for fully a quarter of an hour, groaning,
writing, and crossing out words. He labored
as hard as before, and finally held the
paper off at arm&#8217;s length and contemplated it
admiringly through his silver spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he said, nodding his head
several times in a pleased way; &#8220;that reads
just the same&mdash;little abrupt, maybe, but they&#8217;ll
git the hang of it, and it&#8217;ll please Sally Jane,
who is a good darter. Here, young man, jist
figger onto that, will you, and let me know how
much the expense is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben took the paper, and under the labored
manipulation of the old farmer, he found it
was changed in this amazing fashion:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I take my hand&mdash;Damietta. Jim, your
brother&mdash;the baby is dead&mdash;I expect to eat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Cousin Maria, and sleep in the river to-morrow
afternoon&mdash;with the roan&mdash;if she ain&#8217;t too
buggy. Your affectionate father,
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Josiah A. Jones</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>It was hard for Ben to suppress his laughter,
but the farmer was looking straight at him, and
the boy would not hurt his feelings. He surveyed
the message a minute, and then said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can help you a little on this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can try if you want to,&#8221; grunted the
old man; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think you can improve
much on that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Under the skillful magic of the boy&#8217;s pencil
the telegram was speedily boiled into this
shape:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Met Jim&mdash;all well&mdash;meet me with roan to-morrow
afternoon.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. A. Jones</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;There are ten words,&#8221; explained Ben,
&#8220;and that will cost you twenty-five cents. Besides,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
it tells all that is necessary, and will
please your daughter just as much as if it were
five times as long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Jones took it up again, held it up at
arm&#8217;s length and then brought it closer to him,
while he thoughtfully rubbed his chin with the
other hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s right,&#8221; he finally said, &#8220;but
don&#8217;t you think you orter tell her I have arrived
in Damietta?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She must know you have arrived here, or
you couldn&#8217;t send the telegram to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Umph! That&#8217;s so; but hadn&#8217;t I orter explain
to her that the Jim I met was her
brother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any Jim you expect to see except
your son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s so. I swan to gracious! But I
thought it wasn&#8217;t more&#8217;n perlite ter tell her
that Cousin Maria&#8217;s baby is dead in love with
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that every baby which sees you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
will fall in love with you, and your daughter
must be aware of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this rather pointed compliment the farmer&#8217;s
face glowed like a cider apple, and his
smile seemed almost to reach to his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I swan; but you&#8217;re a peart chap. What
wages do you git?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-five dollars a month.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you airn it, you jist bet; but I was
goin&#8217; to say that I orter speak of the roan mare,
don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you more than one horse that is of a
roan color?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then when you speak of the roan, they
must know that you can only mean the roan
mare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old gentleman fairly beamed with pleasure,
and reaching solemnly down in his pockets,
he fished out another silver quarter, which he
handed to Ben, saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you; take it to please me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you; I have been paid,&#8221; replied
Ben, pushing the coin back from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound it! Take this, then; won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke he banged down a large, red apple
on the counter, and looked almost savagely
at Ben, as if daring him to refuse it.
</p>
<p>The boy did not decline, but picking it up,
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I am very fond of apples. I
will take this home and share it with my
mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next time I come to town I&#8217;ll bring
you a peck,&#8221; and with this hearty response the
farmer stumped out of the door.
</p>
<p>I had been much amused over this scene, especially
when Ben showed me the astonishing
message the farmer had prepared to send his
daughter.
</p>
<p>Ben laughed, too, after the old gentleman
was beyond hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure to do a slight favor like that.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
I think I feel better over it than Mr. Jones does
himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said I; &#8220;for it so happens
that instead of that gentleman being Farmer
Jones, he is Mr. Musgrave, the district
superintendent, who took a fancy to find out
whether his operators are as kind and obliging
as they should be, I am quite sure you lost
nothing that time by your courtesy and accommodating
spirit.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A CALL</h3>
</div>

<p>I have spoken of Ben Mayberry&#8217;s fondness
for athletic sports, and the great benefit he
gained from the exercise thus obtained. When
business permitted, I visited the ball grounds,
where his skill made him the favorite of the
enthusiastic crowd which always assembled
there. He played shortstop, and his activity in
picking up hot grounders and his wonderful
accuracy in throwing to first base were the
chief attractions which brought many to the
place. He was equally successful at the bat,
and, when only fourteen years old, repeatedly
lifted the ball over the left-field fence&mdash;a feat
which was only accomplished very rarely by
the heaviest batsmen of the visiting nines.
</p>
<p>There were many, including myself, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
particularly admired Ben&#8217;s throwing. How
any living person can acquire such skill is beyond
my comprehension. Ben was the superior
of all his companions when a small urchin, and
his wonderful accuracy improved as he grew
older.
</p>
<p>To please a number of spectators, Ben used
to place himself on third base, and then &#8220;bore
in&#8221; the ball to first. In its arrowy passage it
seemed scarcely to rise more than two or three
feet above the horizontal, and shot through the
air with such unerring aim that I really believe
he could have struck a breast-pin on a player&#8217;s
front nine times out of ten. I never saw him
make a wild throw, and some of his double
plays were executed with such brilliancy that a
veteran player took his hand one day as he ran
from the field, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben, you&#8217;ll be on a professional nine in a
couple of years. Harry Wright and the different
managers are always on the lookout for
talent, and they&#8217;ll scoop you in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said the modest Ben, panting
slightly from a terrific run. &#8220;I am a little
lucky, that&#8217;s all; but though I&#8217;m very fond of
playing ball I never will take it up as a means
of living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where your head ain&#8217;t level, sonny.
Why, you&#8217;ll get more money for one summer&#8217;s
play than you will make in two or three years
nursing a telegraph machine. Besides that,
think of the fun you will have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very good, and I can understand
why baseball is so tempting to so many young
men. But it lasts a short time, and then the
player finds himself without any regular business.
His fingers are banged out of shape; he
has exercised so violently that more than likely
his health is injured, and he is compelled to
work like a common laborer to get a living.
Ten years from now there will hardly be one of
the present professionals in the business, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you ain&#8217;t far from the fact, but for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
all that, if I had the chance that you have, I
would be mighty glad to take in all the baseball
sport I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ben was sensible in this respect, and
steadily refused to look upon himself as training
for the professional ball field. In looking
back to that time, I am rejoiced that such is the
fact. There are many of my readers who recall
the popular players of years ago&mdash;McBride,
Wright, Fisler, Sensenderfer, McMullen,
Start, Brainard, Gould, Leonard, Dean, Spalding,
Sweeney, Radcliffe, McDonald, Addy,
Pierce, and a score of others. Among them all
I recall none still in the field. Some are dead,
and the rest are so &#8220;used up&#8221; that they would
make a sorry exhibition if placed on the ball
field to-day.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry was a swift and skillful
skater, and in running there was not a boy in
Damietta who could equal him. It was by giving
heed to these forms of healthful exercise,
and by avoiding liquor and tobacco, that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
preserved his rosy cheeks, his clear eye, his
vigorous brain, and his bounding health.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how do you do, Ben?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad looked up from his desk in the office,
one clear, autumn day, as he heard these words,
and I did the same. There stood one of the
loveliest little girls I ever looked upon. She
seemed to be ten or eleven years of age, was
richly dressed, with an exuberant mass of yellow
hair falling over her shoulders. Her large,
lustrous eyes were of a deep blue, her complexion
as rich and pink as the lining of a sea
shell, and her features as winsome as any that
Phidias himself ever carved from Parian
marble.
</p>
<p>Ben rose in a hesitating way and walked toward
her, uncertain, though he suspected her
identity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this&mdash;no, it cannot be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am Dolly Willard, that you saved
from drowning with my poor mamma last
winter. I wrote you a letter soon after I got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
home, but you felt too important to notice it,
I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the laughing girl reached her hand over
the counter, while Ben shook it warmly, and
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wrote to me? Surely there was some
mistake, for I never got the letter; I would
have only been too glad to answer it. Maybe
you forgot to drop it in the office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it to Uncle George, and told him to
be careful and put it in the mail, and he said he
did so when he came home, so it was not my
fault. But I am visiting at my cousin&#8217;s in
Commerce Street, at Mr. Grandin&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to have a grand party there
to-night, and I&#8217;ve come down to ask you to be
sure and be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted to receive your invitation,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; said I, as Ben looked appealingly
toward me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. Yes, Miss Dolly, I count
upon great pleasure in being present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come, I&#8217;ll never speak to you
again,&#8221; called the pretty little miss as she
passed out of the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry and troubled about one thing,&#8221;
said Ben to me, when we stood together.
&#8220;This Uncle George of Dolly&#8217;s is the G. R.
Burkhill who received that cipher dispatch. I
am satisfied he is a villain, and there&#8217;s trouble
close at hand.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AT THE GRANDIN MANSION</h3>
</div>

<p>Ben Mayberry was born in Damietta, and
his parents, as I have shown, were extremely
poor. He had been a barefooted urchin, who
was ready to fight or engage in any reckless
undertaking. As he grew older and became
more thoughtful, he assumed better clothing,
grew more studious, and, helped by his fine
ability and prepossessing looks, became popular.
</p>
<p>In addition, his remarkable skill in athletic
sports made him well liked among the rougher
element, who would have been glad had he consented
to &#8220;train with their crowd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of all this, Ben failed to secure the
social recognition to which he was entitled.
Many who would greet him most cordially on
the street never thought of inviting him to their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
homes. Damietta had been a city long enough
to develop social caste, which lay in such distinct
strata that there seemed no possibility of
their ever mingling together.
</p>
<p>I was glad, therefore, when Dolly Willard
called at the office and personally invited Ben to
attend the party at Mr. Grandin&#8217;s, which was
one of the most aristocratic families in Damietta.
They were originally from the South,
but had lived in the city a long time.
</p>
<p>My young friend was somewhat dubious
about going, as he had never before been invited
to cross the threshold; but there was no
refusing the warm invitation of Dolly, who
had walked all the way to the office on purpose
to secure his presence at the gathering that
evening.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry was proud of Dolly; that is,
proud that it had fallen to his lot to befriend
such a splendid girl, but there were several
things that made him thoughtful.
</p>
<p>In the first place, my reader will recall that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the cipher telegram which was of such a compromising
character was addressed to her
uncle. Ben had hunted out from the files in
the office the first disguised message, and it
clearly referred to a contemplated robbery of
one of the banks in Damietta. This G. R.
Burkhill was a criminal who was playing a
desperate game, in which he was likely to lose.
</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that he was connected by
relationship with Dolly Willard, who was the
cousin of the Grandins; but it was certainly
impossible that either Dolly, the Grandins, or
Mrs. Willard herself, knew the character of
the man. Such was the view Ben took of the
matter, adding to himself:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he will keep away, and that nothing
more of the intended robbery will be heard. It
is now the fall of the year, and they seemed
to agree that it was the time when the crime
was to be attempted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was one of the grandest children&#8217;s parties
ever given in Damietta. Little Dolly Willard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
had mourned her mother&#8217;s loss as deeply as
could any child, but those of her years soon
rally from affliction, and she was among the
happiest of the three-score boys and girls who
gathered in the roomy parlors of the Grandin
mansion that beautiful night in October.
</p>
<p>The wages which Ben Mayberry received
enabled him to dress with excellent taste, and,
poor as he was, there was none of the sons of
the wealthiest merchants in Damietta who was
more faultlessly attired that evening. True,
some of them sported handsome gold watches,
and one or two displayed diamonds, of which
Ben had none, but otherwise a spectator would
have placed the young telegraphist on the same
social footing with the aristocratic youths
around him.
</p>
<p>Among the numerous misses present were
many dressed with great elegance, and possessing
much personal beauty; but Dolly Willard,
by common consent, surpassed them all in
personal loveliness, while the rich and severe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
simplicity of her attire showed either the exquisite
taste of herself or of someone who had
the care of her.
</p>
<p>Among such an assemblage of misses and
youths there are as many heart-burnings as
among their elder brothers and sisters. Dolly
was decidedly the belle of the evening. Some
of the other girls were so envious over her superior
attractions that they openly sneered at
her, but the aspiring youth were dazzled by the
sprightly girl, who attracted them as though
she were a magnet and they had a big supply
of steel about their persons.
</p>
<p>When Ben Mayberry entered the parlor a
little late, Dolly was standing among a group
of lads who were smiling and bowing, and
making desperate attempts to be funny with a
view of drawing her attention especially to
them. It was natural that she should be somewhat
coquettish, but the instant she caught
sight of Ben Mayberry she almost ran to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t come,&#8221; she exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
taking both his hands in hers; &#8220;and
if you hadn&#8217;t, I never, never, never would have
spoken to you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben unquestionably was a handsome lad.
His bright eyes, his white, even teeth, his
slightly Roman nose, his well-shaped head, his
clear, bright eye, and his rosy cheeks flushed
with excitement, rendered him an attractive
figure among the bright faces and well-dressed
figures. His superb physical poise lent a grace
to all his movements, while he was self-possessed
at the most trying times.
</p>
<p>He made a laughing reply to Dolly, who at
once seated herself beside him and began chatting
in her liveliest style, which was very lively
indeed. To those who approached, she introduced
him as the young man who had saved
her life the preceding winter, until Ben begged
her to make no further reference to it. Many
of the other girls gathered around, and showed
their admiration of Ben in a most marked manner.
These were mostly from Boston or New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
York, who had heard of the young hero, but
had never looked upon him before.
</p>
<p>Dolly was talking away with lightning speed
to Ben, who managed to edge in a word now
and then, when a dapper young man of sixteen
years spruced forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to form for the lancers,
Miss Dolly; I believe I have your promise for
my partner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, Rutherford, but I have
changed my mind, and will dance with Master
Ben.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a daring and almost unwarranted
act on the part of the little empress, for Ben
had not yet spoken to her on the matter. But
he was quick to seize the advantage, and, instantly
rising to his feet, offered his arm to
Dolly, and started toward the dancing-room,
as though the whole thing had been prearranged
before the other party presented himself.
</p>
<p>This act brought him face to face with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
disappointed young man, whose countenance
flushed with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rutherford, this is he who saved my life
last winter, Master Ben Mayberry; my friend,
Rutherford Richmond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two saluted each other somewhat distantly;
and with feelings which it would be
hard to describe, Ben recognized the tall, rather
callow youth as the Rutherford who stoned
him several years before, when he was floating
down the river on a log, and to whom Ben
in turn had given a most thorough castigation.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE CONSPIRACY</h3>
</div>

<p>Rutherford Richmond recognized Ben
Mayberry at the same instant that the latter
identified him. But neither gave any evidence
of the fact that could be understood by other
parties.
</p>
<p>Ben took his position with Dolly by his side,
and they were without doubt the handsomest
couple on the floor that evening. Their mutual
interest was so marked that everyone present
noticed it, and it caused comment without end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe he sweeps out the office for a
telegraph company. He manages to save up
enough money in the course of a year to buy
a decent suit of clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry was sitting down at the end
of one of the dances, when he overheard these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
words, which he knew referred to him. Dolly
had excused herself for a few minutes, and he
was alone, sniffing at a fragrant bouquet which
he was protecting from all damage for her
benefit.
</p>
<p>He knew, further, that the remark was intended
for his ears, but he affected not to
know it, while he furtively glanced behind him.
There stood Master Rutherford Richmond,
with three or four lads. They were all jealous
of Ben, and were discussing his merits for his
own especial benefit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand he gets fifty cents a week for
his work,&#8221; observed another, making sure his
voice was elevated enough to be heard half
across the room, &#8220;which is a big sum for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why Miss Jennie&#8221; (referring
to Jennie Grandin, who gave the party)
&#8220;allows such cattle here,&#8221; struck in a third, in
the same off-hand manner.
</p>
<p>Rutherford Richmond took upon himself to
give the reason.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was all on account of Dolly. You know
she is kind-hearted, and I understand this
booby went to her and begged that she would
give him a chance to see how a party of high-toned
people looked. She couldn&#8217;t very well
refuse, and now she is trotting him around for
the rest of us to laugh at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry&#8217;s cheeks burned, for none of
these words escaped him. He would have
given a good deal to have been outside alone
for a few minutes with Master Rutherford
Richmond. But he could not call him to account
under the circumstances, and he still
sniffed at the bouquet in his hand, and affected
to be very much interested in the action of a
couple of misses on the opposite side of the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Miss Jennie permits anything of this
kind again,&#8221; volunteered Rutherford, &#8220;it will
cause trouble. A good many will want to
know, before they allow their children to come,
whether they are liable to meet the telegraph
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
office boy and the great ball player here; if
there&#8217;s danger they will stay at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the scum of society should be kept
in its place,&#8221; observed another, scarcely less
bitter than young Richmond in his jealousy of
the lad who claimed so much of the attention
of the little belle of the evening.
</p>
<p>This kind of talk was going on when, to
Ben&#8217;s great relief, Dolly came tripping to him.
He added gall to the cup of the envious youths
by rising, giving her his arm, and then glancing
triumphantly back at them, as he escorted
her to the dining room.
</p>
<p>They knew the meaning of the glance, and
they were fierce enough to assault him had they
dared to do so.
</p>
<p>The party came to an end before midnight.
Ben Mayberry had saluted his friends, and was
in the hall preparatory to going home, when
someone slyly pulled his arm. Turning, he saw
that it was Ned Deering, a little fellow whose
father was the leading physician in Damietta.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Ned was a great admirer of Ben, and he now
seized the occasion to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, Ben, when you get down by the
bridge over the creek; they&#8217;re going for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That Rutherford Richmond and another
fellow mean to hide in Carter&#8217;s Alley, and
when you come along will pounce down on you.
They wanted me to go with &#8217;em, but I begged
off without letting &#8217;em know I meant to tell
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; asked Ben, glancing
furtively about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They slipped out ahead, and are hurrying
down there. You had better take another way
home. They are awful mad, and will knock
the stuffing out of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry smiled over the earnest
words and manner of the boy, and thanked him
for his information.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em know I told you,&#8221; added the
timid fellow, as Ben moved out the door; &#8220;for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
if they find out that it was me that was the
cause of your going the other way home, why,
they&#8217;d punch my head for me. That Richmond,
they say, is a reg&#8217;lar fighter&mdash;has
science, and can lay out anybody of his size.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will never know you said anything
to me, Ned, for I shall take the usual way, and
will be slow, so as to give them plenty of time
to get there ahead of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little fellow looked wonderingly at Ben
as he walked away, unable to comprehend how
anyone should step into a yawning chasm after
being warned of his peril.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>AN AFFRAY AT NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>Ben Mayberry was so desirous that Rutherford
Richmond and his brother conspirator
should be given all the time they needed to
complete their scheme for waylaying and assaulting
him, that he lingered on the road
longer than was really necessary.
</p>
<p>Finally he turned down the street, which
crossed by the creek that ran through the center
of Damietta. It was a clear moonlight
night, and, except in the shadow, objects could
be seen distinctly for a considerable distance.
He advanced with great care, and with all his
wits at command, for he was confident the
warning given him by Ned Deering was well
founded.
</p>
<p>When within a block of the bridge he saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
someone peep out of Carter&#8217;s Alley and instantly
draw back his head, as though fearful
of being observed. A moment later, a second
person did the same. Rutherford Richmond
and his confederate were on hand.
</p>
<p>They did not look like the two boys as seen
in the glare of Mr. Grandin&#8217;s parlors, for they
had disguised themselves, so far as possible,
with a view of preventing their recognition by
the boy whom they meant to assault. They
knew they were liable to get themselves into
trouble by such an outrageous violation of law,
and they meant to take all the precautions
necessary.
</p>
<p>Each had donned a long flapping overcoat,
which must have belonged to some of the older
members of the families, as it dangled about
his heels. They also wore slouch hats like a
couple of brigands, which they pulled down
over their eyes, so as to hide their features.
They had no weapons, for it was calculated
that by springing upon Ben unawares they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
would easily bear him to the pavement, when
both would give him a beating which he would
remember for a lifetime.
</p>
<p>Ben was whistling softly to himself, and
he was glad that at the late hour no one else
was seen in the immediate neighborhood, for
all he asked was a clear field and no favor.
</p>
<p>As he walked by the open end of Carter&#8217;s
Alley, he dimly discerned two figures, which
seemed plastered against the wall in the dense
shadow, where they were invisible to all passers-by,
unless their suspicion was directed to
the spot.
</p>
<p>Ben gave no evidence that he noticed them,
and moved along in his deliberate fashion,
changing his whistling to a low humming of
no particular tune; but he used his keen eyesight
and hearing for all they were worth.
</p>
<p>He had gone no more than a dozen feet beyond,
when he heard a rapid but cautious footstep
behind him. It increased in swiftness, and
was instantly followed by a second. The two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
boys were approaching him stealthily from the
rear.
</p>
<p>Still Ben walked quietly forward, humming
to himself, and with no apparent thought of
what was coming. Suddenly, when Richmond
was in the very act of making a leap upon his
shoulders, Ben turned like a flash, and planted
a stunning blow directly in the face of the exultant
coward, who was knocked on his back
as if kicked by a vigorous mule.
</p>
<p>His companion was at the elbow of Richmond
when struck in this emphatic fashion,
and for the instant was bewildered by the unexpected
catastrophe. Before he could recover
he imagined the comet which was expected
at that season had caught him directly
between the eyes, and he went backward over
Richmond, with his two legs pointing upward,
like a pair of dividers, toward the stars.
</p>
<p>Ben&#8217;s blood was up, and he waited for the
two to rise, intending to &#8220;lay them out&#8221; more
emphatically than before. The lad whose name
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
he did not know lay still, but Rutherford recovered
with remarkable quickness, and began
struggling to his feet, without paying heed to
his hat, which had rolled into the gutter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t fair to strike a fellow that way,
when he ain&#8217;t expecting it,&#8221; growled the assassin.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stand still like a man
and not hit below the belt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I give you notice then, friend
Rutherford, that I am going for you again,
and this time above the belt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Richmond, finding he must fight, threw up
his hands and did his best to guard against the
blows whose force he knew so well. He did
possess some knowledge of sparring, but so
did Ben, who was much the stronger and more
active of the two. He advanced straight upon
Richmond, made several feints, and then
landed a blow straight from the shoulder, at
the same time parrying the cross-counter which
the lad came near getting in on the face.
</p>
<p>It so happened that, at that moment, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
other young scamp was in the act of rising,
and had got upon his hands and knees. As
Richmond was sent spinning backward he
came in collision with him, and turned a complete
somersault, the air seeming to be full of
legs, long hair, hats, and flapping overcoats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder! help! help! police! police!&#8221;
</p>
<p>These startling cries were shouted at the top
of their voices by the discomfited poltroons, and
were heard a long distance on the still night.
Suddenly the rattle of running feet sounded on
the planks of the bridge, and Ben caught sight
of a policeman running toward the spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he demanded,
when he came face to face with Ben, whom he
motioned to stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two fellows attacked me when I was
passing Carter&#8217;s Alley, and I&mdash;well, I defended
myself as best I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ben, that is you; I didn&#8217;t know you at
first,&#8221; said the policeman. &#8220;This is rather serious
business; I&#8217;ll run &#8217;em in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Advancing to where the boys were once
more climbing to their feet, he grasped each by
the collar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you along with me, young gents;
this is serious business for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They begged piteously to be let off, declaring
that it was only a joke, but the officer was
inexorable, and marched them to the station
house, where they spent the rest of the night,
Ben Mayberry having been notified to be on
hand at nine o&#8217;clock the next morning, when the
police justice would make an investigation.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE THIRD TELEGRAM</h3>
</div>

<p>When the father of Rutherford Richmond&#8217;s
friend, at whose house the young Bostonian
was visiting, learned the facts, he was indignant
beyond description. He declared that
Ben Mayberry had served the young scapegraces
right, except he ought to have punished
both more severely, which was rather severe,
as was shown by the blackened eyes and
bruised faces.
</p>
<p>Ben declined to push the matter on the morrow,
as the boys had been punished, and he had
proved he was able to take care of himself, as
against them, at any time. But the gentleman
insisted that he would not permit the matter
to drop, unless his son and Rutherford agreed
to go to the telegraph office and beg the pardon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
of the boy whom he learned they had insulted
under Mr. Grandin&#8217;s roof. Rutherford and
his friend consented, and they humiliated themselves
to that extent. The succeeding day
Rutherford went home to Boston, and did not
reappear in Damietta until long afterward,
when he hoped the disgraceful episode was
forgotten.
</p>
<p>On the following week Dolly Willard returned
to New York, and Ben, for the first
time in his life, began to feel as though his
native city had lost a good deal of the sunshine
to which it was entitled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She will visit Damietta again,&#8221; he said to
himself, with just the faintest sigh, &#8220;and she
promised to write me; I hope she won&#8217;t forget
her promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, indeed, the sprightly little miss did not
lose sight of her pledge. It may be suspected
that she took as much pleasure in expressing on
paper her warm friendship for Ben, as he did
in reading the pure, honest sentiments, and in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
answering her missives, which he did with
great promptness.
</p>
<p>It was just one week after the memorable
night of the party, while I was sitting at my
desk, that the following cipher dispatch came
over the wires, addressed to G. R. Burkhill,
Moorestown:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Fwfszuijoh hr pl nm ujnf Sgtqdezw bu
bnqmdq. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Tom.</span>&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>I passed the message to Ben, whose eyes
sparkled as he took it in hand. It required
but a few minutes for him to translate it by
the method which has already been made
known, and the following rather startling
words came to light:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Everything is O. K. On time Thursday
at corner.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>This unquestionably referred to the same unlawful
project outlined in the former dispatches.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Mr. Burkhill had not been in the
office for months. As yet, of the three telegrams
sent him, he had not received one. The
first was lost in the river, the second had been
on file more than half a year, and we now had
the third.
</p>
<p>But the latter did not lie uncalled for even
for an hour. Remembering the instruction received
from the manager, I took a copy of the
message, with the translation written out by
Ben, to the office of the mayor, where I laid
the facts before him. This was on Wednesday,
and the contemplated robbery was fixed
for the following night. By his direction I
sent a dispatch at once to the address of the
detective in New York, who, it had been arranged,
was to look after the matter.
</p>
<p>The reply to this message was the rather
surprising information that Detective Maxx
had been in Damietta several days, and knew
of the contemplated robbery. He was shadowing
the suspected party, and if he deemed it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
necessary, he would call on the mayor for assistance.
</p>
<p>While I was absent from the office, who
should walk in but Mr. G. R. Burkhill. He
greeted Ben with much effusion, shaking him
warmly by the hand, inquiring how he got
along, and telling him that his niece sent her
special regards to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been on a trip to New Orleans,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;or I would have been down in Damietta
sooner, for I like the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The summer isn&#8217;t generally considered a
good time to go so far south,&#8221; ventured Ben.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true, as relates to Northerners, but
I was born in the Crescent City, and have no
fear of Yellow Jack; fact is, I have had the
confounded disease myself. By the way, have
you a message for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two, in fact I may say three, for
the copy of the first one that went down the
river with me has never been handed you, and
one came a day or two after you left.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what they are, so you needn&#8217;t
mind about them. I will take the last, if you
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It arrived within the last half hour,&#8221; explained
Ben, as he handed the damp sheet to
him.
</p>
<p>The boy watched his countenance while
Burkhill was reading it. It took several
minutes for him to study out its meaning, but
he did so without the aid of pencil or paper.
A strange glitter came into his gray eyes as
the meaning broke upon him, and he muttered
something to himself which the lad did not
quite catch.
</p>
<p>Then he turned to the desk, and was engaged
only a minute or two when he handed a return
message to Ben, paying for it as the man had
done who forwarded the other to him. It was
this:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Uibu rthsr fybdumz Vhkk cf qdzex.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>G. R. Burkhill.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>Applying his rule (which compelled him to
go to the end of the alphabet, when, for instance,
the letter &#8220;a&#8221; demanded to be represented
by a preceding letter), Ben Mayberry
very readily translated the cipher as follows:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;That suits exactly. Will be ready.
</p>
<div class='ra'>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>DECIDEDLY MIXED</h3>
</div>

<p>During the summer succeeding the carrying
away of the bridge which connected Damietta
with Moorestown, it was built in a more substantial
manner than before. It was an easy
matter, therefore, to cross from one place to
another, and carriages and pedestrians went
back and forth between the two States at almost
every hour of the day. Damietta was a
large city, while Moorestown was only a small
town; but the latter was pleasantly located and
had a large and excellent hotel, where quite a
number of guests spent the most sultry months
of summer.
</p>
<p>In Damietta were three banks, and the cipher
telegrams which I have laid before the reader,
beyond a doubt referred to one of them, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
was impossible to fix with certainty upon the
right one. As a matter of prudence, therefore,
it was determined to keep the three under surveillance.
The Mechanics&#8217; Bank, as it was
called before it adopted the national system,
stood on the corner, and the general impression
prevailed that this was the institution referred
to, as it will be remembered that the
word &#8220;corner&#8221; occurred in one of the telegrams.
</p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; reflection convinced me that
it was utterly out of the question for the intended
robbery to succeed. Such desperate
projects depend mainly on their secrecy for success.
The watchmen in all the banks were instructed
to be unusually vigilant, the policemen
were apprised of what was suspected, a
number of officers were to lounge upon the
streets near at hand in citizens&#8217; clothes, and
Aristides Maxx, one of the most skillful detectives
in the metropolis, was engaged upon
the case.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>The general belief was that the burglars,
discovering what thorough preparations were
on foot, would not make the attempt. That
sort of gentry are not the ones to walk into
any trap with their eyes open.
</p>
<p>Respecting Detective Maxx, there was much
wonderment, and the mayor was vexed that
he did not show up. Some doubted his presence
in Damietta, but the superior officer of
the city felt that courtesy demanded that Maxx
should report to him before trying to follow up
any trail of his own. If he was with us, he
was so effectually disguised that no one suspected
his identity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder whether that seedy, tramp-like
fellow who stole the cipher dispatch, can be
Detective Maxx?&#8221; said Ben to me on Wednesday
night before he started for home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not impossible,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;for detectives
are forced to assume all manner of
disguises. He may have chosen to stroll about
the city in that make-up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But if it is the detective, why did he go
to all the trouble of copying off the telegram
by sound when he could have got it from us
with the translation merely by making himself
known?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that, if he is a detective, he acts, in
my judgment, in a very unprofessional way.
He was so persistent in his attentions that he
must have known he was sure to draw unpleasant,
if not dangerous suspicion, to himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Ben, with a meaning
smile, &#8220;that I half believe this stranger and
Burkhill are partners? They have been here
at the same time, they show interest in the same
thing, and like enough are working out the
same scheme of robbery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This had never occurred to me, and I was
struck with its reasonableness, when I came to
think it over. The ill-favored individual
signed the name &#8220;John Browning&#8221; to the
dispatch which he sent some months before, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
a pretext for visiting our office so much&mdash;but
that was clearly an alias.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;it is all conjecture any
way. With the ample warning the authorities
have received, I do not believe there is the
slightest prospect of a robbery being committed.
I intend to retire to-morrow night at
my usual hour with little fear of my slumbers
being disturbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes after, we bade each other
good-night, and wended our way quietly homeward.
</p>
<p>My experience was singular, after parting
with my young friend&mdash;not meaning to imply
that anything unusual occurred to me; but the
mental processes to which I was subjected that
evening, in the light of subsequent events, were
very peculiar, to say the least.
</p>
<p>I am convinced that the inciting cause was
the remark made by Ben Mayberry to the effect
that he believed the seedy individual was a
confederate of Burkhill, and that the two were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
perfecting a scheme for robbing one of the
banks&mdash;most likely the Mechanics&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben is right,&#8221; I said to myself. &#8220;His
bright mind has enabled him to grasp the truth
by intuition, as a woman sometimes does when
a man has been laboring for hours to reach
the same point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But before I could satisfy myself that the
boy was right, a still stronger conviction came
to me that he was wrong. The men were not
pals&mdash;as they are called among the criminal
classes&mdash;and they were not arranging some
plan of robbery.
</p>
<p>While I was clear on this point, I was totally
unable to form any theory to take the place of
the one I had demolished.
</p>
<p>Who was the pretended John Browning, and
what was the dark scheme that was being
hatched &#8220;in our midst,&#8221; as the expression
goes?
</p>
<p>These were the questions which presented
themselves to me, and which I could not answer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
in a manner thoroughly satisfactory to
myself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all wrong&mdash;everybody is
wrong!&#8221; I exclaimed to myself; &#8220;whatever it
is that is in the wind, no one but the parties
themselves knows its nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was the conclusion which fastened
itself in my mind more firmly the longer I
thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,
and it is the only thing which will protect us
in this case&mdash;helloa!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So rapt was I in my meditation that I had
walked three squares beyond my house before
I awoke to the fact. It was something which
I had never done before in all my life.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>BETWEEN TWO FIRES</h3>
</div>

<p>In the meantime, Ben Mayberry underwent
an experience more peculiar than mine.
</p>
<p>I cannot speak of the mental problems with
which he wrestled, but, as he explained to me
afterward, he had settled down to the belief
that the Mechanics&#8217; Bank was the one against
which the burglars were perfecting their plans.
He was hopeful that the only outcome of the
conspiracy would be the capture of the criminals,
though he felt more than one pang when
he reflected that the principal one was a relative
of Dolly Willard, who was the personification
of innocence and goodness to him.
</p>
<p>Ben had acquired the excellent habit of always
being wide awake, excepting, of course,
when he lay down for real slumber. Thus it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
was that he had gone but a little distance on
his way home when he became aware that
someone was following him.
</p>
<p>I doubt whether there is a more uncomfortable
feeling than that caused by such a discovery.
The certainty that some unknown
person, with no motive but a sinister one, is
dodging at your heels, as the mountain wolf
slinks along behind the belated traveler, awaiting
the moment when he can spring upon him
unawares, is enough to cause the bravest man
to shiver with dread.
</p>
<p>The night was very dark. The day had been
cloudy, and there was no moon; but Ben was
in a large city, with an efficient police system
(that is, equal to the average), there were
street lamps, the hour was not unusually late,
and there were other persons beside himself
abroad. And yet, in the heart of the metropolis,
at the same hour, crimes have been perpetrated
whose mystery has never been unraveled
to this day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Ben Mayberry may have felt somewhat uneasy,
but there was not so much fear as there
was curiosity to know what earthly reason any
living man could have for following him in
that stealthy fashion.
</p>
<p>Surely no one could suspect him of being
burdened with wealth. The only article of any
account about his person was a silver watch,
which had cost him sixteen dollars. He never
carried a pistol, for he saw no necessity for
doing so. If he should find himself beset by
enemies who were too strong to be resisted, he
could run as rapidly as any person in the city,
and a short run in Damietta was enough to
take him to a place of safety inaccessible to his
assailants.
</p>
<p>When he turned into the narrow street which
led across the bridge where he had his affray
with Rutherford Richmond and his companion,
he reflected that it was perhaps the most dangerous
spot in the neighborhood. There was
a single lamp just before stepping on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
bridge, where one might run against another
before seeing him.
</p>
<p>He hesitated a minute as he made the turn.
It was easy enough to reach his home by a
different route, which was somewhat longer,
but which was well lighted all the way, and
there could be little risk in taking it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stick to the usual way,&#8221; muttered Ben,
striding resolutely forward; &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
anything like murder is contemplated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment he would have felt much
more comfortable had he possessed a pistol, or
some kind of weapon, but he did not hesitate,
now that he had &#8220;put his hand to the plow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute later he stepped on the bridge,
where the gas lamp shone upon him, and, with
his usual deliberate tread, passed off in the
gloom of the other side. The instant he believed
himself beyond sight of his pursuer, he
quickened his gait but continually looked back
in the hope of gaining a view of the man, for
the boy was naturally eager to learn who it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
was that was playing such a sinister trick on
him.
</p>
<p>Just beyond, on the limit of his field of
vision, Ben saw a shadowy figure cross quickly,
to the other side of the street. The stranger
did this before coming within the glare of the
lamp, which would have revealed him too
plainly to those who might be curious to secure
a glimpse of his features.
</p>
<p>An instant later his footfall was heard on
the bridge, and he was walking rapidly toward
Ben, crossing again to the same side of the
street, as soon as over the stream. The boy
stepped lightly but briskly forward until he
reached Carter&#8217;s Alley, into which he entered
a couple of yards, and then came to a sudden
halt.
</p>
<p>At the moment of doing so, his foot struck
something hard. He knew what it was, and,
stooping down, picked up a large stone, which
he held tightly grasped in his hand. Such a
weapon was very formidable in the grip of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
vigorous boy, who could throw with the skill
and accuracy of Ben Mayberry.
</p>
<p>The lad had scarcely halted when he caught
the tip, tip of his pursuer, who was evidently
determined to overtake him before he reached
the lighted regions beyond. Ben was astonished
just then, to note that a second person
was just approaching from the opposite direction
in the same guarded fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be there are two of them,&#8221; was
the sensible conclusion of the boy; &#8220;they
have agreed to meet here, where I wouldn&#8217;t
have much show against them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It followed that the party of the second part
was waiting for the coming of young Mayberry,
doubtless with the understanding that
his partner in crime should follow him to a
certain point near at hand, when the two would
close in on him.
</p>
<p>Ben had never suspected any such conspiracy
as this, and, had he gone a little further, he
would have walked directly into the arms of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the second ruffian, while peering behind him at
the shadowy villain who &#8220;still pursued him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the lad had stopped short and disconcerted
the plans of the conspirators by so
doing. The one who was lying in wait was
quick to miss the boy whom he had seen cross
the bridge, and, suspecting something was
wrong, he hastened stealthily toward the creek
to learn the explanation.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>BAFFLED!</h3>
</div>

<p>It so happened that the two men stopped
directly at the mouth of the alley, within a few
feet of Ben Mayberry, who could hear their
guarded words, though he could not catch the
first glimpse of their figures.
</p>
<p>A whistled signal or two first made them
certain of each other&#8217;s identity, and then the
one who had crossed the bridge gave utterance
to an oath, expressive of his anger, as he demanded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where has he gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; growled the other.
&#8220;I waited where you told me to wait, and finding
he didn&#8217;t come, I moved down to meet
him, but he don&#8217;t show up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sh! Not so loud. He can&#8217;t be far off.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how that is, but he&#8217;s given
us the slip. There&#8217;s an alley right here, and he
has turned into that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. Because he&#8217;s standing
still and listening to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Flash your bull&#8217;s-eye into the alley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Ben Mayberry heard this order he
trembled, as well he might, for he was so close
to the scoundrels that the first rays of the lantern
would reveal him to them. Indeed he dare
not move, lest the noise, slight as it was, would
bring them down on him.
</p>
<p>He grasped the ragged stone in his hand and
braced himself for the explosion that he was
sure was at hand.
</p>
<p>But fortunately, and most unexpectedly, the
crisis passed. The other villain growled in
return:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by talking about a
bull&#8217;s-eye? I doused the glim long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The cops are watching us too close. I had
hard work to dodge one of &#8217;em to-night. Do
you s&#8217;pose I meant to have him find any of the
tools on me? Not much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other emitted another sulphurous expression,
and added the sensible remark:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no use of our hanging around
here. He&#8217;s smelt a mice and dodged off, and
we won&#8217;t get another such a chance to neck
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>These words sounded very strange to Ben
Mayberry. Well might he ask himself what
earthly purpose these scamps could have in
wishing to waylay him in such a dark place,
where he was not likely to secure help. The
latter part of their conversation proved they
contemplated violence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing certain,&#8221; Ben said to
himself, &#8220;if I manage to get out undiscovered,
I will see that I am prepared for such gentlemen
hereafter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The couple suddenly stopped talking, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
sound of approaching footsteps were heard.
The two moved into the alley, and a minute
after a heavy man came ponderously along
with a rolling tread. He was puffing at a
cigar, whose end glowed so brightly that the
tip of his nose and his mustache were seen by
the three standing so near him. Ben believed
the wretches intended to assault and rob the
citizen, and doubtless they were none too good
to do so. In case the attempt was made, Ben
meant to hurl the stone in his hand at the spot
where he was sure they were, and then yell for
the police.
</p>
<p>Policy alone prevented the commission of
the crime.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have managed it easily,&#8221; whispered
one, as the portly citizen stepped on the
bridge and came in sight under the lamp-light,
&#8220;but I guess it was as well we didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it wouldn&#8217;t have paid as matters stand.
We might have made a good haul, but the excitement
to-morrow would have been such that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
we wouldn&#8217;t have had a show to-morrow
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The heart of the listening Bob gave a quick
throb, for this was another proof of the intended
crime on Thursday evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; added one, &#8220;that telegraph fellow
was too smart for us this time, and has given
us the slip. We may as well go home, for
there&#8217;s nothing more to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thereupon they began walking toward the
creek, with the deliberate tread of law-abiding
citizens, who, if encountered anywhere on the
street at any hour, would not have been suspected
of being &#8220;crooked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry had good cause for feeling
indignant toward these ruffians, who clearly
intended personal violence toward him, and
who were, in all probability, desperadoes from
the metropolis, brought into Damietta for the
most unlawful purposes.
</p>
<p>When they had gone a short distance, Ben
stepped out of the alley upon the main street,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and stood looking toward the bridge. This
was slightly elevated, so that in approaching
from either side, one had to walk up-hill. The
illumination from the lamp, of which I have
made mention, gave a full view of the structure
itself and all who might be upon it. Ben
saw his pursuer, in the first place, when he
stepped on the planks, but the light was at his
back, and he shrouded his face so skillfully that
not a glimpse was obtained of his features.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the conspirators slowly advanced
out of the gloom and began walking
up the slight ascent toward the bridge, becoming
more distinct each second. When they
reached the middle of the structure, they were
in plain sight, but their backs were toward
Ben, who, however, had them where he wanted
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can plug one of them,&#8221; muttered
the shortstop of the Damietta club, as he carefully
drew back his arm and fixed his eye on
the fellows. &#8220;At least, here goes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>Gathering all his strength and skill, he hurled
the stone at the one who, he believed, had been
lying in wait for him. The whizzing missile
shot through the air like a cannon-ball, and
landed precisely where the thrower intended,
directly between the shoulders of the unsuspecting
villain, who was thrown forward several
paces by the force of the shock, and who
must have been as much jarred as though an
avalanche had fallen on him.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>WATCHING AND WAITING</h3>
</div>

<p>What imaginings were driven into the head
of the ruffian by the well-directed missile it
would be impossible to say, but it is safe to
conclude he was startled.
</p>
<p>His hat fell off, and, without stopping to
pick it up, he broke into a frantic run, closely
followed by his companion, neither of them
making the least outcry, but doubtless doing
a great deal of thinking.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry laughed until his sides ached,
for the tables had been turned most completely
on his enemies; but he became serious again
when he wended his way homeward, for there
was much in the incidents of the day to mystify
and trouble him.
</p>
<p>His mother had retired when he reached his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
house, but there was a &#8220;light in the window&#8221;
for him. The fond parent had such faith in
her son that she did not feel alarmed when he
was belated in coming home.
</p>
<p>Ben made a confidante of her in many things,
but the truth was he was outgrowing her. She
was a good, devout lady, but neither mentally
nor physically could she begin to compare with
her boy.
</p>
<p>Had he made known to her the contemplated
robbery, or his own narrow escape from assault,
she would have become nervous and
alarmed.
</p>
<p>Ben did not tell her about the affray with
Rutherford Richmond and his companion, for
it would only have distressed her without accomplishing
any good.
</p>
<p>He saw that his terrible adventure the preceding
winter, on the wrecked bridge, had
shocked her more than many supposed, and
more than she suspected herself. The consequences
became apparent months afterward,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and caused Ben to do his utmost to keep everything
of a disquieting nature from his beloved
mother.
</p>
<p>On the morrow Ben told me the whole particulars
of his adventures on the way home,
and asked me what I made of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it up,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s beyond
my comprehension.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like a wealthy youth?&#8221; he asked,
with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not that; they have some other purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they imagine I carry the combination
to some safe in the city, and do they mean to
force it from me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of that sort, as you very well
know. It looks as if they really meditated
doing you harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no room for doubt; and it was
a lucky thing, after all, that the night was so
dark, and the city don&#8217;t furnish many lamps
in that part of the town. Do you think I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
ought to tell the mayor or some officer about
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you identify either of the men if
you should meet him on the street?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not, unless I was allowed to examine
his back, where the stone landed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no use of telling anyone
else, for no one could help you. You had better
carry a pistol, and take a safer route home
after this. One of these days, perhaps, the
whole thing will be explained, but I own that
it is altogether too much for any fellow to find
out just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was natural that I should feel nervous the
entire day, for there was every reason to believe
we were close upon exciting incidents, in
which fate had ordered that Ben Mayberry and
myself would have to make the initial movements.
</p>
<p>Neither Burkhill, the tramp-like looking individual,
nor any character to whom the least
suspicion could attach, put in an appearance at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
the telegraph office during the day; this was
another disappointment to Ben and myself.
</p>
<p>The mayor also was disposed to be uncommunicative,
for when I dropped in on him during
the afternoon, he was short in his answers,
barely intimating that everything was in a satisfactory
shape. When asked whether Detective
Maxx had revealed himself, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen nothing of him, and do not
care to see him. His help is not needed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I am convinced that the action of the famous
detective had a great deal to do with the ill-humor
of the mayor, who was generally one
of the most affable of men.
</p>
<p>I was pretty well used up, and at eleven
o&#8217;clock I closed the office and went home, separating
as usual from Ben Mayberry, who, I
was satisfied, intended to know whether anything
was amiss before he lay down to slumber.
</p>
<p>Although the impression was general that
it was the Mechanics&#8217; Bank which was the objective
point of the conspirators, yet the chief
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
of police, as I have intimated, had stationed
his men so as to be ready for instant use, should
it prove to be any one of the moneyed institutions.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry was so well satisfied that it
was the Mechanics&#8217; that, after leaving me, he
went in that direction, anxious to see a first-class
burglary attempted and foiled.
</p>
<p>The institution, it will be remembered, stood
on the corner of one of the main streets, and a
lamp was burning directly opposite. The cashier
reported that two suspicious characters had
called during the day and made some inquiries
about drafts on New York, and the officers,
who had spent much time in the neighborhood,
were convinced that they had seen the same individuals
stealthily viewing the bank from the
outside.
</p>
<p>When Ben reached the vicinity he saw no
person, although he well knew that in almost
every dark nook and hiding place, a guardian
of the law was stationed, quietly awaiting the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
moment when the lawbreakers would dare
show themselves. Ben knew, too, that more
than one pair of eyes carefully scrutinized him
as they did every pedestrian who passed.
</p>
<p>He continued along until he reached a point
where he could stand without being noticed
by anyone. Then he stopped, and, wide awake
as ever, resolved that he would see the thing
out if he was forced to stand where he was until
the rising of the sun on the morrow.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;LAY LOW!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The clock in the tower of the City Hall
solemnly boomed the hour of midnight. Damietta
lay wrapped in slumber&mdash;that is, so far as
the majority of her citizens were concerned.
Her guardians of the peace, as a rule, were
wide awake, and the dozens stationed within
the vicinity of her three national banks were
particularly so.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry counted the strokes of the
iron tongue, and reflected that Thursday was
gone, and Friday had begun. As yet nothing
had been seen or heard to indicate that anything
unlawful was contemplated in this immediate
neighborhood. More than once he
was so well convinced that my view of the case
was correct, that he was on the point of starting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
homeward, but he checked himself and
stayed.
</p>
<p>At such a time the minutes drag with exceeding
slowness, and it seemed to Ben that
fully a couple of hours had gone by, when the
huge clock struck one. During the interval a
number of pedestrians had passed, and a party
of roystering youths rode by in a carriage, each
one singing independently of the other, and in
a loud, unsteady voice, but nothing yet had occurred
on which to hang a suspicion.
</p>
<p>The peculiar, ringing, wave-like tones,
which are heard a few minutes after the striking
of a large bell, were still lingering in the
air and gradually dying out, when one of the
policemen gave a guarded whistle, which was
a signal for the others to &#8220;lay low,&#8221; or in
better English, to keep themselves unusually
wide awake.
</p>
<p>A minute after two men were heard approaching,
and became dimly visible in the
partial illumination of the street. It so happened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
that they walked directly by where Ben
was standing. They did not notice him,
though he plainly saw them. They were of
large frame, and walked with a slight unsteadiness,
as though under the influence of liquor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the bank,&#8221; said one, in an undertone,
as though he was imparting a momentous
secret to the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; if we could only get in, knock
the watchman on the head, and kick in the
door of the safe, we would make a good haul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we try it, Jack&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>For more than two hours a burly watchman
had been hidden close at hand, without Ben suspecting
his presence. The last sentence was in
the mouth of the speaker when this policeman
sprang upon the amazed strangers, who were
discussing the burglary of the bank.
</p>
<p>He must have been surcharged with faithfulness,
for, instead of waiting until an overt
act was committed, as all had been instructed to
do, he rushed upon the men in a burst of enthusiasm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
which knew no restraint and passed
all bounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll rob the bank, will you?&#8221; he
shouted, swinging his club aloft and bringing
it down on the heads of the others. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
you&mdash;we&#8217;ve been watching you. We know
you. You&#8217;re a fine set of cracksmen. You
think Damietta is a country town, but you&#8217;ll
learn different&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>These vigorous observations were punctuated
with equally vigorous whacks of the club,
which it seemed must crack the skulls of the
men, and in all probability would have done so
had they not risen to the exigencies of the case
and turned upon the policeman with remarkable
promptitude.
</p>
<p>Both of them were powerful, and finding
themselves assailed in this fashion, one knocked
the officer half-way across the street, wrenched
his club from his grasp, and began laying it
over his head. The stricken guardian of the
peace shouted for help, and tried desperately to
draw his revolver. Finally he got it out, but
before he could use it that also was taken from
him, and it looked as though little would be
left of him.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>But the other policemen came running up,
and took a hand in the fracas. While some
went for the one who was belaboring the representative
of the law, others made for the
second burglar. But he was more muscular, if
possible, than his friend, and he laid about him
with such vigor that three officers were prostrated
before he could be secured. Calling to
his friend, the two gave themselves up, demanding
to know why peaceable citizens
should be clubbed when quietly walking along
the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had not uttered a disrespectful word,&#8221;
said the first, &#8220;but were joking together, when
that brass-buttoned idiot pounced upon us. We
simply defended ourselves, as every man has a
right to do, and we don&#8217;t propose to let the matter
rest here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He lies!&#8221; shouted the officer who had fared
so ill, as he came forward, his hat off, and his
clothing covered with dust; &#8220;he was arranging
to rob the bank; they are the burglars that
we&#8217;ve been watching for days; I know &#8217;em all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to take you along,&#8221; said the
chief, who saw that matters were considerably
mixed.
</p>
<p>At this point Ben thought it was his duty to
interfere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will permit me, I am satisfied that
some mistake has been made. These gentlemen
did nothing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of &#8217;em,&#8221; broke in the first officer,
whose wrath could not be appeased; &#8220;he&#8217;s been
their dummy; he was on the lookout to give &#8217;em
warning; run him in, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Despite Ben Mayberry&#8217;s protests, he was
forced to go with the prisoners; but on the way
to the lock-up he was recognized by several
officers, including the chief, who ordered his release,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Ben promising to appear in the morning
at the hearing.
</p>
<p>On the morrow several important facts came
to light. The two individuals who had been so
roughly used were honest countrymen, whose
references to the robbery of the bank were
purely in jest&mdash;such a project as burglary never
entering their thoughts.
</p>
<p>The policeman who assailed them made a
humble apology, and they agreed to let the matter
drop.
</p>
<p>Another fact that was established was that
the policemen of Damietta were very much like
those of other cities.
</p>
<p>The third truth was, that no burglary took
place on Thursday night or Friday morning,
and everything was as quiet as the surface of a
summer mill-pond, with the single exception of
the incident just narrated.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>After all the elaborate preparations for the
capture of the burglars, the whole business had
fallen so flat that the officers of the law themselves
laughed at the farcical termination.
Nothing criminal was attempted, and Damietta
never was more peaceful in all its history than
it was during the many weeks and months
which followed.
</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of all this, there could be no
question that such a burglarious scheme at one
time was contemplated. The cipher telegrams,
and the surveillance to which Ben Mayberry
was subjected, together with the attempted assault
upon him, made this too manifest to be
disputed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They simply discovered the preparations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
made by the authorities,&#8221; I said to Ben, &#8220;and
they had prudence enough to withdraw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe they have given it up altogether?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it. They have simply deferred the
execution until some safer time. We must continue
to be on the lookout for telegrams in
cipher. These gentry have evil designs upon
Damietta, as will be proven before we are
many years older.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Ben Mayberry reached the age of
fifteen, he attained an important epoch in his
life. He had long been one of the most skillful
operators in the district, being remarkably
quick and accurate.
</p>
<p>I have told enough to prove his courteous
disposition toward all who entered our office.
The pretended Mr. Jones, who acted the part
of the ignorant farmer, was, as I have stated,
a high official of the company, who took odd
means to test the character and skill of our employees.
The test in the case of young Mayberry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
proved most satisfactory in every respect.
</p>
<p>At my request, I was transferred to one of
the cities in the Eastern States, where the climate
agreed better with me. I was given charge
of an important office, an advance made in my
wages, and everything was done to make the
change agreeable. Such being the fact, it is no
assumption on my part to say that my administration
of the exacting duties in Damietta had
been fully appreciated by my superior officers.
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry was made manager of the
office in his native city at a salary of seventy-five
dollars per month. This statement the
reader may doubt, for I am quite certain that
no telegraphist of his age was ever given such
an important charge, nor is anyone so young
paid such a liberal salary; but, did I feel at liberty
to do so, I could locate Ben Mayberry so
closely that all skeptics could ascertain the
facts, in a brief time, precisely as I have given
them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>We have many office managers, in different
parts of the country, who lack several years of
their majority; but, as a rule, their stations are
not very important, and their pay is nothing
like what Ben received. There were exceptional
circumstances in his case. He was unusually
bright, he was very attentive, he was
courteous, cheerful, and never shirked work.
He was popular with our patrons, and much of
the increase in the business of the Damietta
office was due to Ben alone. This became
known to those above him, and they felt that
an unusual promotion on his part would not
only be a just recognition of his ability and devotion,
but would do much to stimulate others
to imitate the good example set by the boy.
</p>
<p>In addition to all this, it cannot be denied
that fortune favored Ben in a marked degree.
The fact that he was swept down the river in
the darkness and tempest, while trying to deliver
a telegram for a messenger who was ill,
and that he saved the life of a little girl, could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
not fail to operate strongly to his benefit. But
he would have reached the end all the same,
without these aids, just as you, my young
friend, may attain the topmost round by climbing
up, up, up, step after step, step after step.
</p>
<p>There is no cup in this life without some
drops of bitterness, and, despite the promotion
of Ben, which he fully appreciated, he was
cast down by another circumstance, which
troubled him more than he would admit to his
closest friends.
</p>
<p>He had not seen sweet Dolly Willard since
the grand children&#8217;s party at Mr. Grandin&#8217;s,
more than two years previous. She had written
him regularly every week for months, and
he had been equally prompt in answering. Ben
wrote a beautiful hand, and his missives to
Dolly were long and affectionate. She would
have visited her cousins in Damietta, had they
not made a visit to Europe, which shut off the
possibility of her doing so for some time to
come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>Ben felt that under the circumstances it was
hardly the thing for him to make a call upon
Dolly in New York, though she invited him to
do so.
</p>
<p>But during the very week that Ben was given
charge of the Damietta office, the mail failed
to bring the usual letter from Dolly. He
waited impatiently for several days and then
wrote to her. There was no response to this,
and he felt resentful. He held out for a fortnight,
and then was so worried that he was
forced to write again. But this was equally
fruitless of results, and he became angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is getting to be quite a large girl; her
folks are wealthy, and she has begun to realize
that I am nothing but a poor telegraphist. Her
folks have told her she must look higher, and
she has come to that same mind herself. Ah,
well; let it be so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was expressive of his feelings. Sometimes
Ben felt like rebelling against his fate.
He had applied himself hard for years; he possessed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
an excellent education; he held a prominent
position in the greatest telegraph company
of the country, with a prospect of further advancement
before him, and yet, because he was
poor, he was looked down upon by those who
were his inferiors in everything except the
single one of wealth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great disappointment,&#8221; he sometimes
murmured, &#8220;but I am young; most folks would
laugh that one of my age should take such a
fancy to a little girl like Dolly, and they would
say I am certain to get over it very soon. And
just there is where they would all make a great
mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Ben Mayberry was right on that point.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>FACE TO FACE</h3>
</div>

<p>Ben Mayberry was sitting at his desk in
the Damietta office, one beautiful day in Indian
summer, attentive as ever to his duties, when a
carriage drove up to the door containing a
young gentleman and a lady. The former
sprang lightly out and ran into the office, after
the manner of one who was in a hurry to send
an important telegram.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, while Ben was looking at the
youth he recognized him as Rutherford Richmond,
with whom he had had several important
meetings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rutherford, you have grown so
much I didn&#8217;t recognize you; I am glad to see
you; how have you been?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>Ben reached his hand over the counter as he
greeted the young man, but the latter affected
not to hear him. Turning to the desk, he
wrote out a message with great rapidity,
wheeled about, and, without the slightest evidence
of ever having seen Ben, handed him the
paper and ordered the dispatch to be sent to
New York.
</p>
<p>This was the telegram:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Richard Willard</span>, No.&mdash; Avenue, New York:</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Dolly and I reached here safe. Big party
at Grandin&#8217;s to-morrow; sure of grand time.
Will take good care of Dolly.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rutherford Richmond</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>As the writer hurried out the door, Ben followed
him with his eyes. There, in a handsome,
single-seated carriage, sat a beautiful
miss of thirteen or fourteen, elegantly dressed
and looking straight toward him. It was Dolly
Willard, more enchanting than ever, her eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
luminous with health and her cheeks as
pink and rosy as the delicate tint of the
coral.
</p>
<p>Ben was too shocked to salute her, and probably
it was as well he did not do so, for she
simply stared with scarcely less directness than
did her companion.
</p>
<p>Only by the most supreme exertion was the
youth enabled to choke down his rebellious
emotions, so that none in the office noticed his
excitement.
</p>
<p>It was the same on the morrow, and, as if
the fates had combined to crush him in absolute
wretchedness, he encountered Rutherford
and Dolly riding out as he was making his way
homeward. He affected not to see them, but
he could not avoid furtively watching Dolly,
who certainly was the most winsome-looking
young miss he had ever seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night another party is given by the
Grandins. Their girls are ladies, and they
treated me well when I was there more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
two years ago, but in this matter Dolly has had
all to say&mdash;that is, she and Rutherford. Well,
if she is that sort of girl, I don&#8217;t want anything
to do with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night, in spite of himself, Ben could
not stay at home; he strolled along, a prey to
his bitter thoughts, and mechanically walked in
the direction of the splendid grounds of the
wealthy jeweler, Mr. Grandin. The sound of
music from within aroused him.
</p>
<p>He saw the lights glimmering through the
beautiful shade trees, and could catch sight of
the gayly-dressed figures flitting by the open
windows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t feel any worse,&#8221; muttered Ben,
walking through the open gate, confident that
he would attract no special attention.
</p>
<p>He sauntered up the graveled walk, turning
off to the right and moving slowly along, with
his gaze fixed upon the gay lads and lasses
within, who seemed to be in the very height of
enjoyment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>At that instant someone caught his arm,
and Ben turned with an apology for his forgetfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, but I was so interested in
the scene that I did not notice where I
stepped&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, fairly gasping for breath, for
there stood Dolly Willard at his side, with her
hand upon his arm. The light streaming from
the windows fell upon her charming face, on
which there was an expression that young
Mayberry did not understand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; said she, in a voice that sounded unnatural,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something I want to say to
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have a good deal that I would like to
say to you,&#8221; he retorted, firing up, now that
the little empress stood before him.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>STARTLING DISCOVERIES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You say you have something to speak
about,&#8221; added the boy, looking into the enchanting
face, as it reflected the light from the
windows near at hand; &#8220;I have only to suggest
that it took you a good time to find it out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not I, but you who are to blame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly I am to be blamed for being born
poor while you are rich; but I have paid for
my mistake, and it is now too late to correct
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conversation had reached this point
when the two seemed to conclude it was altogether
too public to be in good taste. Several
persons, standing near, stepped a little closer, so
as to catch every word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so warm in there,&#8221; said Dolly; &#8220;even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
with the windows open, that I came outdoors to
get the fresh air. Aunt Maggie put my shawl
about my shoulders so that I wouldn&#8217;t take cold.
Now, Ben, if you will walk with me to the
summer-house yonder, we can sit down by ourselves,
finish our talk, and then part forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last expression sent a pang to the boy&#8217;s
heart, but he did not allow her to see it. He
followed her a short distance to one of the romantic
little lattice-work structures which Mr.
Grandin had placed on his grounds.
</p>
<p>A few rays of silvery moonlight penetrated
the leafy shelter, so the two were not in complete
darkness when they sat down on the rustic
seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready to listen to you,&#8221; said Ben in
his most frigid voice, the two being separated
by a space of several feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, if you thought so lightly
of me, you never should have told me different
nor asked me to correspond with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How can you help understanding me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I see no reason for your words.
I thought all the world of you; the greatest
pleasure of my life was to write to you and to
receive your letters in return. All at once you
stopped writing; I sent you three letters, and
you paid no attention&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben, how dare you! It was you who
laughed at my letters, and took no notice of
them, except to show them to your friends and
ridicule what I put on paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry sprang to his feet. Like a
flash it came upon him that some dreadful misunderstanding
had been brought about by
other parties, for which Dolly was not to
blame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the whole story, Dolly,&#8221; he said in
a kinder voice than he had used since they met,
as he resumed his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, beginning to feel the same
suspicion that thrilled her companion, &#8220;there
is a good deal to say, but I will make it short.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
You know my father and Mr. Grandin are
cousins, so the girls are really my second
cousins. Rutherford Richmond is the son of
an old friend of father, who lives in Boston.
Father has a large insurance office, and he
agreed to take Rutherford until he learned the
business, so as to take charge of the same kind
of office in Boston, which his father is going
to fix up for him. That&#8217;s how it is Rutherford
has been living with us for some months.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a good while ago, I wrote you a letter,
begging you to come and visit me; father
said I might do so. You didn&#8217;t accept the invitation.
I wrote you again and got no answer
to it; I was frightened, and thought maybe you
were ill, and wrote once more, but there was
no answer to it. I would have sent a letter to
Cousin Jane to find out about you, but she was
in Europe. After a while I sent a fourth letter,
very long, and full of things which I wouldn&#8217;t
have anyone else know for the world. I
sent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who by?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rutherford took it and several other letters,
and placed them in the mail-box at father&#8217;s
office, so they were sure to go. But there was
no answer to the last, and then I gave up. I
felt awful bad; but I was nearly wild when
Rutherford came to me one day and said he
had something which he thought he ought to
tell me. When he said it was about you, I was
dreadfully excited. He told me that he had
made the acquaintance of a young man from
Damietta, who was a close friend of yours.
That young person, whose name Rutherford
would not give, said that you showed all my
letters to him and several others, and made fun
of them. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if he
hadn&#8217;t proved what he said?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he prove it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By repeating what I had written; he gave
me half of what was in that last letter, which
he said was repeated to him by the person you
told. He had them so exactly that my face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
burned like fire, and I was never so angry in
all my life. I knew you must have done what
Rutherford said, for how could he know what
I had written you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew it by opening your letter, reading
the contents, and then destroying it. That letter,
Dolly, I never saw, nor did I see the three
which preceded it. I also sent you three letters,
of which I never heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now that the way was opened, full explanations
quickly followed. There could be no
earthly doubt that the last three letters sent by
Ben Mayberry to Dolly Willard had been intercepted
by Rutherford Richmond, who had
not hesitated to do the same with those sent by
Dolly, though most probably he had simply destroyed
the three, and read only the last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You risked your life to save mine and that
of my mother,&#8221; she said in a tremulous voice,
&#8220;and it was an awful thing for you to believe
I could ever fail to think more of you than of
anyone else in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I shall have to own up,&#8221; laughed
the happy Ben; &#8220;but we were both placed in a
false position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we shall never be again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolly, Dolly! Where are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cries came from a gay party of misses
who came trooping forth to look for the belle,
whose absence so long from her friends had attracted
inquiry.
</p>
<p>She sprang up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Ben; I must go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She caught his hand and returned the pressure,
then hurried out and met her young
friends, who escorted her back to the house,
while Ben quietly departed without attracting
attention.
</p>
<p>It was past midnight, but Ben thought
nothing of time. He had turned off from the
street and entered the main business avenue of
Damietta.
</p>
<p>Just as he came opposite the large jewelry
establishment of Mr. Grandin he glanced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
through the plate-glass window. A light was
burning dimly in the rear of the store, as was
the custom with many of the merchants in the
city, but at the instant of looking Ben saw
something like a shadow flit by the light. He
looked again, and was certain that another
movement had taken place, though he could
not define its character.
</p>
<p>He paused only an instant, when he walked
on again; but in that instant he became convinced
that burglars were operating in the
jewelry establishment of Mr. Grandin.
</p>
<p>He walked slowly forward, humming to
himself, as was his custom, but wide awake
and alert. Fifty feet further, he detected the
shadowy figure of a man standing in one of
the adjoining doorways. Ben pretended not to
see him, and continued humming gayly to himself.
</p>
<p>Ben sauntered along in the same aimless
fashion until sure he was not watched, when he
turned and made his way directly to the police
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
office. The chief was there and Ben quickly
told him everything he knew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the parties who arranged to rob
the bank year before last,&#8221; said the chief, &#8220;but
found out they were suspected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly managed it well this time;
that is, so far, for there hasn&#8217;t a single cipher
telegram passed through our office since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are ready to move,&#8221; said the
chief, as he observed that four of his best officers
were awaiting his orders.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>IN THE NICK OF TIME</h3>
</div>

<p>Ben would have liked to accompany the officers,
but that would have been unprofessional
on their part, and he did not make the request.
He waited until they had been gone several
minutes, when he slipped out and passed down
the street, determined to see what was to be
seen.
</p>
<p>The chief managed the delicate and dangerous
business with great skill.
</p>
<p>The first notice the burglars had of danger
was from the rear. They were down behind
a screen of dark muslin they had put up, carefully
working at the safe, which contained diamonds
and jewelry of immense value. They
had already drilled a considerable distance into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the chilled iron, when the &#8220;Philistines descended
upon them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The burglars sprang up like tigers, but they
were caught so fairly that they were borne to
the floor and handcuffs clicked around their
wrists in a twinkling. There were only two,
and the three policemen mastered them without
difficulty.
</p>
<p>But there were two others on the street outside,
and they were quick to discover what was
going on within. One of these was Dandy
Sam, who ran forward and peered through the
front window. His companion was at his elbow,
and they instantly saw that something
was wrong.
</p>
<p>They turned to flee, when they found themselves
face to face with the chief and his aid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up your hands!&#8221; commanded the
chief, leveling his pistol at the villains.
</p>
<p>One of them complied, but Dandy Sam fired
point-blank at the chief, whirled on his heel,
and ran like a deer down the street. The chief
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
was not touched, and pistol in hand he started
after the criminal, leaving his aid to attend to
the second one.
</p>
<p>Dandy Sam was fleet of foot and was gaining
on his pursuer, when he came face to face
with Ben Mayberry, who was hurrying toward
the scene of the burglary with a view of seeing
how it terminated.
</p>
<p>The two encountered where the lamp-light
showed the face of each. Ben knew the scamp
on the instant, from the description given him,
and the sight of the flying rascal told him the
truth.
</p>
<p>Ben had his pistol in his pocket, but he could
not bear the thought of shooting a person, especially
when there was a possible doubt of
the necessity.
</p>
<p>Ben compromised matters by darting into
the road, where he caught up a stone weighing
fully a pound.
</p>
<p>The chief was some distance away shouting
&#8220;Stop thief!&#8221; and firing his pistol over his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
head, so there could be no doubt that Dandy
Sam was &#8220;wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ben Mayberry stood about as far from the
fugitive as the space between first and second
base&mdash;thirty yards&mdash;when the stone left his
hand like a thunderbolt. As before, it sped
true to its aim, but struck higher than then,
sending the scoundrel forward on his face, and
stunning him; only for a minute or so, but this
was sufficient.
</p>
<p>While he was in the act of climbing to his
feet again, the chief dropped upon him; there
was a click, and Dandy Sam was at the end
of his career of crime, at least for a considerable
time to come.
</p>
<p>The chief started for the station-house with
his man, whom he watched closely despite the
stunning blow he had received.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the other three officers
came in with their prisoners, who were caught
in the very act of committing burglary.
</p>
<p>The aid was absent so long that the chief felt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
uneasy, and started out in quest of him, but at
that moment he appeared with his man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went peaceably enough for a while,&#8221; explained
the aid, &#8220;and then he tried to bribe me
to let him go. When he found that wouldn&#8217;t
work he became ugly, and I had to use my club,
but he ain&#8217;t hurt much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His face was bleeding, but Ben Mayberry,
with a shock, recognized the prisoner as G. R.
Burkhill, the uncle of Dolly Willard.
</p>
<p>The capture of the burglars made great excitement
in Damietta, and the part taken by
Ben Mayberry once more placed his name in
everyone&#8217;s mouth. It was he who discovered
the criminals, and was the direct means of securing
the desperado, Dandy Sam, the leader
of the notorious gang.
</p>
<p>It was a great shock to all, except a few, to
find that Burkhill, the brother-in-law of Dolly
Willard&#8217;s father, was also one of the guilty
ones. But there were others (and among them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Mr. Willard and Mr. Grandin) who were not
surprised in the least. The facts in this singular
affair, as they ultimately came to light, were
as follows:
</p>
<p>George R. Burkhill was the black sheep in
a most estimable family, of which Mrs. Willard,
the mother of Dolly, was a member. She
was the sister of Burkhill, and the only one
who clung to the bad brother, pronounced incorrigible
by everyone else, even when a small
boy. She believed there was some good in him,
and, in the face of protests, she labored to bring
him to a sense of right. It was through her influence
that he was saved from condign punishment
for more than one serious offense.
</p>
<p>All four of the burglars were duly tried,
found guilty, and sentenced to the penitentiary
for ten years. Rather curiously, both Dandy
Sam and Burkhill died during the third year
of their imprisonment, and it is safe to say the
world was the gainer thereby.
</p>
<p>Some few days after the capture of the burglars,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
came a glowing letter from Dolly, who
had gone home to New York, in which she said
that her father insisted that Ben should come
and make them a visit, and would accept no
excuse for refusing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go this time!&#8221; exclaimed Ben, knowing
he would have no trouble in obtaining permission
to take a brief vacation.
</p>
<p>And go he did.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>In closing the history of Ben Mayberry, the
telegraph messenger boy, it seems to me I can
do no better than by using the words of the
hero himself. The following letter I received
only a few days since. It is the last which has
come to hand from Ben, who writes me regularly,
as he has done ever since I was transferred
from the office in Damietta. I should
add that the date of the letter is nine years
subsequent to that of his visit to the metropolis
as the guest of Mr. James Willard:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Mr. Melville</span>,&mdash;I am now in
my twenty-fifth year. In looking back it seems
only a few years ago that you called me to
you, on the street of my native city, and offered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to make me general utility boy in the telegraph
office of Damietta. My mother and I were
nearly starving at the time, and no kindness
could have been more appropriate than yours,
nor could anyone have shown greater tact and
wisdom in cultivating the good instincts of a
ragged urchin, who, otherwise, was likely to
go to ruin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You awakened my ambition and incited
me to study; you impressed upon me the beauty
and truth of the declaration that there is no
royal road to learning; that if I expected to attain
success in any walk of life it could only be
done by hard, unremitting, patient work.
There are many rounds to the ladder, and each
must climb them one by one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good fortune attended me in every respect.
It was the providence of God which saved me
and enabled me to help save sweet Dolly when
the bridge went down in the storm and darkness,
and her mother was lost; yet, but for my
determination to do my best at all times, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
never to give up so long as I could struggle, I
must have succumbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was extremely fortunate that I saw the
burglars at work in the jewelry establishment
of Mr. Grandin on that memorable night in
Damietta. The same stroke of fortune might
have fallen to any boy, but it was incomplete
until I was able to bring the leader to the
ground with the stone which I hurled at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be said that all these are but mere
incidents of my history, and possibly I may
have magnified their importance; but, though
my progress was rapid, it never could have carried
me successfully along without the regular,
systematic, hard work with which I employed
my spare hours, when not devoted to exercise.
In this world that which wins, is work, work,
work!
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was fifteen years old, I was made
the manager of the office in Damietta, with a
larger salary than I was entitled to. Three
years later, the partiality of Mr. Musgrave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
made me assistant superintendent, and now I
have been general superintendent of the district
for more than two years, with a handsome
salary, which enables me to give my dear
mother comforts and elegances of which the
good lady never dreamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I married Dolly shortly after my promotion
to the office of general superintendent, and
the little fellow that is learning to lisp &#8216;papa,&#8217;
you know, has been named after you, my old,
true, and invaluable friend, to whose counsel
and kindness I feel I am so much indebted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolly sits at my elbow and continually reminds
me that I must insist that you come down
and spend Christmas with us. A chair and
plate will be placed at the table for you, and
you must allow nothing less than Providence
itself to keep you away.

<p><i>Ralph Victor is probably the best equipped writer of
up-to-date boy&#8217;s stories of the present day. He has
traveled or lived in every land, has shot big game
with Sears in India, has voyaged with Jack London,
and was a war correspondent in Natal and Japan.
The lure of life in the open has always been his, and
his experiences have been thrilling and many.&mdash;&#8220;Progress.&#8221;</i>
